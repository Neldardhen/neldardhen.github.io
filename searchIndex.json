Nalataren forces suffered a bitter defeat in the South East and Egerot is taking control of the lands. Daetor noble of one of the Southern estate and ex-officer in the Nelataren army is looking to flee Nelatar. Not wanting to risk going through Egerot controlled territory, he decided for an itinerary through the mountains. He engaged a guide : Arlas, and a small group of adventurers to protect him, his wife Fidala and his steward Dagan during the dangerous journey.\nOthers hopeless individuals join your group during the beginning of your travel, Ekanro a Priest-Healer of Ordel and his apprentice Sila and a Masked woman named Nerena.\nYou began your journey shortly after the beginning of summer, but soon after you reached the mountains the weather turned for the worst. A blizzard is raging and you are now stuck in a refuge waiting for the sky to clear. Each night you barely make out the notes of a melancholic song covered by the screaming winds.

She is clearly not used in the life outside the city. Even if uncomfortable, she is rarely seen complaining.\nShe evidently has live a sheltered life until now and doesn't seem to understand the struggle of the common people, but she also seems to be open minded enough to be able to learn.\nShe displays a timid curiosity.\nDagan\n\nDagan (They / Them), early 50s, is a human from Nelatar.\nThey have served Daetor Avaroand his family for most of their life.\nThey seem to be lawful enough or crazy enough to follow their employers into the perilous journey through the mountains.\nThey display a mix of masculine and feminine behaviours, something unusual in Nelatar.\nArlas\n\nArlas (They / Them), in their second century, is an elf from Alfir.\nThey know the region well an act has your guide during this journey.\nThey have an animal companion, a snow leopard named Quicksilver.\nThey are not used to be awake in the day as they usually have a crepuscular lifestyle.\nAt night, they like to watch the stars, looking for guidance.\nEkanro\n\nEkanro (He / Him), early 40s, is a human, Priest-Healer of Ordel.\nHe seems to be part of the minority of priests who chose to travel the country to help those in needs.\nHe has a good knowledge of herbs and posses a variety of plants and mushrooms that he uses to cure or alleviate different ailments.\nHe has an apprentice named Sila .\nSila\n\nSila (She / Her), 12 o 13 years old, is a human apprentice to become a healer.\nShy and studious, Sila doesn't talk to the adults with the exception of her Master Ekanro.\nHer clothes are made of poor quality wool and are worn and dirty, with the exception of her light blue cloak which is brand new and of superior quality.\nShe also possesses a crude iron ring that she wears on the thumb of her right hand.\nNerena\n\nNerena (She / Her), mid 30s, is a human from Serna.\nShe wears a half wooden mask at all time and makes no secret of her allegiance.\nRelations between Ekanro and her are tense, but they seemed to have tacitly agreed to not talk to each others.\nNerena seems to be avoiding the Priest-Healer as much as she can.",

She is helpful with the people that are helpful to her. She likes fancy expensive coffee from Uruithel.\nThe hexagon and the use of blood is not a common practice for the scholars of the Uni.\nThere is an &quot;Other Truth&quot; Lodge in the city, he knows its location.\nUlda is at the head of the Lodge in Ostorrómë. He helps her with her garden on her bad days.\n\nThe Lynyals\nEach night the Lynyals sense the portal opening and try to return to it, but it is to small to accommodate them. They can be heard whining, trying to call to others on the other side of the portal.\nThey are heavily stressed and exhausted from living in a world they are not used to.\nThey gain 1 level of Stress for every 3 days they have been in the Garden and 1 level of Exhaustion for every week. Disturbed by the sun, they have not been able to sleep properly and have already lost 2d8 Resilience when the PCs meet them.\nAt the time Daîrgon and the PCs meets they have been there for 14 days. (4 levels of Stress and 2 levels of Exhaustion).\nWhen the PCs arrive between 30 and 25 meters of them the can try a (Low Light Perception) checks to notice the Lynyals moving in the flowers patches.\nIf they are not noticed, one of the Lynyal will emit its Spiritual Screech if one of the PCs come between 8m of it.\nThe Lynyals will not attack unless provoke. They will try to defend the portal and are hesitant to flee from it. They might try to flee, &quot;kiting&quot; their attackers and come back to the portal from an other direction.\nIf the PCs don't act aggressively to the Lynnyals, they can try an (Animal Handling -30) to convince the Lynyals to let them approach the portal and the magic circle.\nRewards\n\nIf the players help the Lynals back through the portal, give them each an Inspiration token.\n\nThe Portal\nThe portal is only a tiny hole that looks like a 5 cm (2 inches) diameter 2d circle floating 1 meter (3 feet) above ground.\nTiny but very bright fireflies of a variety of colours can be seen going in and out of the portal. Cold air comes from the portal and smells of a forest.\nBeyond the Portal\nLooking into the flat black circle that is the portal, this sight is revealed.\n\nYou see a forest bathed in cold moonlight. Strange luminescent plants move smoothly in a soft wind. Bright fireflies dance in the air sometimes getting lost on your side of the portal.\n\n(Magic Affinity / Raw Magic) A faint magical energy is present around the portal itself, but quickly dissipating. This portal will probably close forever in a couple of days.\nThe Magic Circle\nNear the portal is the rest of the magic circle that Nolmo and Istyar used for their ritual.\n\nMagic circle with a starred hexagon -&gt; (Arcane Magic) (Culture: Iris Countries + 10 ) if the blood was discovered those checks get an additional + 10 : It is not standard magical practice.

The books and various documents that took water were frozen (at great cost and in a hurry) to keep them from being damaged. They are now delicately unfreezing them and assessing the damages.\nParma the head librarian is supervising the operations.\nWhat Parma knows or can find:\n\n(Persuasion/Lying/Intimidation) Living location of any student or teachers of the Uni.\n\nGifting her expensive coffee or helping her in any other way will convince her to give those information.\n\nNames, office and domain of study of the teachers of the Uni.\n\nNolmo's office\n\nNolmo office is a huge mess. If the PCs spend 1 full hour searching the office they will find :\n\nA <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/adventures/mystery-in-ostorrome-handouts/#ba04fb\">Magical Wax Tablets</a> with the end of a conversation written on it.\nVials of blood among other vials of strange liquids and concoctions\nSmall pouch with bones of small animals\nPages and pages of notes with calculations and esoteric symbology. The last sentence reads : &quot;Direct exposure to moonlight did not seem to have been the contributing factor to the portal stability after all… Next date : 16 of Dandoledniss, don't have a lot of time to prepare, I'll try at home.&quot; <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/adventures/mystery-in-ostorrome-handouts/#4d62d0\">Nolmo's Notes</a>\n\nAderan's office\nAderan office is tidy and clean.

The Dame Blanche died falling of the bridge some 200 years ago while she was coming back home from a trip. She does not remember much from her past life, one of the few things she rememebr is that she likes singing ans dancing.\nShe'll ask the party to sing and dance for her.

He recently had significant advancement in his research and has been able to open unstable portals to Nyalë.

Each one may not be less than 1 or greater than 10.\nEvery even level, your maximum for your Fundamental values increases by 1. (ie. at level 7 you would have a cap of 13. )\n\nFormula : Max Fundamental = 10 + floor(level / 2)\n\nYour focus maximum will be 2 times your Mind value. Your endurance maximum 2 time your Body value and your resilience maximum 2 times your Spirit value.\nNote, since creatures don't suffer from injuries and die as soon as they reach 0 in any resources, this multiplicator becomes a 3 for them.\nYour recovery die for each value will also be based on your fundamentals, following the table below.\n\n*Formula :\nceiling(x/6) d ceiling(x/2) * 2 - ( ( ceiling(x/6) - 1 ) * 6 + ( ceiling( x / 6 ) * 2 ) ), where x is your Fundamental value.\nFormula for a creature :\nceiling(x/6) + 1 d ceiling(x/2) * 2 - ( ( ceiling(x/6) - 1 ) * 6 + ( ceiling( x / 6 ) * 2 ) ), where x is your Fundamental value.*\n\nFundamental value (Mind, Body or Spirit)\nRecovery die (for focus, endurance or resilience)\nRecovery die (for focus, endurance or resilience) for creature\n\n1-2\n1d4\n2d4\n\n3-4\n1d6\n2d6\n\n5-6\n1d8\n2d8\n\n7-8\n2d6\n3d6\n\n9-10\n2d8\n3d8\n\n11-12\n2d10\n3d10\n\n13-14\n3d8\n4d8\n\n15-16\n3d10\n4d10\n\n17-18\n3d12\n4d12\n\n19-20\n4d10\n5d10\n\nAbilities\nFor each of your fundamental value, you have three Abilities depending on it. Logic, Education and Memory depending on the Mind, Physic, Coordination and Senses depending on the Body and finally Wisdom, Empathy and Charisma depending on the Spirit.\nYou may distribute 100 points between those 9 abilities, each of one being comprised between 1 and 20. Additionally, you cannot spend more point in an Ability than your score in its corresponding Fundamental value times 2 plus 5. (ie. Logic &lt;= 2 * Mind + 5).\nCompetences\nCompetences are the heart of the game. You have 320 points to distribute between all of them as long as none of the competences goes over 70.\nLanguages and Lore Knowledge\nChoosing where you spent the first part of your life will determine your native culture and language (See <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/character-creation/character-creation-origins/\">Character Creation - Origins</a>).

How do you keep fighting with a destroyed knee ?\nOne core mechanic of this system is the Injuries, some are temporary and can be heal, some are permanent, but a permanent Injury is not an end to the character ; it is a challenge to the player : How do they manage this Injury and learn to live with it ?\nThis is a story of getting up again, no matter how much time it takes, no matter if we get up on our own legs or find sturdy sticks to keep walking or if we have a friend to carry us the rest of the way.\nSimple, but brutal\nWith those principle in mind, remember that the combats in this system are designed to be simple but brutal. Fighting outnumbered is probably a bad idea and will almost always get you killed. Dying is the end of the road for your character ; there exist no resurection magic in this world.\nFuel for RP\nThe Needs, Injuries and Recovery Activities are the foundations for a character's roleplay. They can change over time and evolve with the character. Players are encouraged to adapt their Recovery Activities in reaction to the new Injuries of their character. A Recovery Activity is not necessary be a healthy habit, it might even be a destructive way to cope.\nThe second pillar of roleplay is the group dynamic. How will the character help each other ? Will they even help ? Will they try to help but do more harm than good in the process ?\nOne-shots or short stories\nFor one-shots or short stories where full character's arcs might not have the time to be properly explore, the GM might one to focus more one NPCs, their problems and how the group might help them (or not).",

		"content": "Basics\nRrules for the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/neldar-system/\">Neldar System</a>.\nEvery character and creature in the game has three Fundamental values representing their Being: Mind, Body and Spirit.\nFor each of those, there are three Attributes.\nAttributes\n\nMind\nBody\nSpirit\n\nActive / Raw Strength\nMemory / Knowledge\nPhysic\nCharisma\n\nReactive / Finesse\nWits\nReaction Speed\nManipulation / Insight\n\nDefensive\nComposure\nPain Tolerance\nVolition\n\nThe value of an attribute is a type of die (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12). An increase in the die category (from d6 -&gt; d8) can be bought with points at character creation or after a level up (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/character-creation/character-creation-points-distribution/\">Character Creation - Points Distribution</a>)\nResources\nEach task will cost a creature one of three resources. focus which is the resource of the Mind, endurance, the resource of the Body and resilience, the resource of the Spirit. The maximum of each resource cannot be higher than three times its corresponding Fundamental Value.\nSkills\nThere are 18 skills separated in three catagories linked to Mind, Body and Spirit.\n\nMind\nBody\nSpirit\n\nArcane Magic\nAthletics\nAnimal Affinity\n\nRhetoric / Linguistic\nCraft\nDeception\n\nCulture / History\nFighting\nIntimidation\n\nInvestigation\nPerformance\nPersuasion\n\nResearch / Sciences\nStealth\nInsight/Empathy\n\nMysticism / Occultism\nThievery\nRaw Magic\n\nThree of the skills are Defense skills, Aracane Magic, Fighting and Raw Magic are taken into account when defending against attacks or damage affecting the corresponding part of the being.\nEach skill as a rank - ranks can be bought with points at character creation or after a level up (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/character-creation/character-creation-points-distribution/\">Character Creation - Points Distribution</a>).\nA rank in a skill cannot be higher than the score in the Fundamental value (Mind, Body or Spirit).\n\nIf Ayrina has a Mind score of 4 and Spirit score of 2, she can buy up to 4 ranks in Arcane Magic, but only 2 ranks in Persuasion.\n\nSkill Checks\nA skill check is done by combining a skill with an attribute. The rank of the skill determine the number of dice that can be bought and the attribute determine the type of the dice.\nThe first die is always free, each additional die costs 1 point of resource (either focus, endurance or resilience depending on the skill used)\nAdditionally, if the skill check is linked to a speciality of the character, then the character gains 1 additional free die for the check.\n\nExample :\nArinya wants to translate a stone tablet written in Ancient Laugsuil.\nThe GM asks for a roll of Linguistic on Memory / Knowledge.\nShe has a rank 2 in Rhetoric / Linguistic and d6 in Memory / Knowledge.\nShe has a specialisation in Ancient Laugsuil.\nShe gets 2d6 for free thanks to 1 free die and her specialisation. However, the GM told her that the check would be quite hard. She decides to spend 2 focus points to get 2 additional dice.\nShe can now roll 4d6 at the cost of 2 focus\n\nSpecialities\nA character can choose a free specialisation when they reach rank 3 in a particular skill.\nAdditionally, some skills let you choose a speciality at ranks 1. Those are Rhetoric/Linguistic, Culture/History, Research/Science, Athletics, Fighting and Performance.\nPushing past your limits\nIf a character has a rank high enough in a skill to buy more dice, but not enough resources to do so, they can choose to buy dice of a category less (d6 -&gt; d4) for twice as much of one other resource.\n\nFrom our example before, let's say that Arinya has only 1 point of focus left. She would not be able to buy the 2 additional dice.\nShe could buy 1 additional d6 for 1 focus, then decide to spend 2 points of resilience to buy an additional d4.\nShe now would be able to roll 3d6 + 1d4 for 1 focus and 2 resilience.\n\nFatigue, Exhaustion and Stress\nIt is still possible to do a task with no resources left, but this will instead increment the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level and prompt a roll on the corresponding Injury table. (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/old-v1-rules/combat-and-injuries-v1/#5a0385\">Injuries</a>).\nIt is also the case if a creature takes damage on a resource (focus, endurance or resilience) which is already at 0.\nIf the cost of the task or the damage received is greater than 9 then the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level increments by 2, similarly if the cost or damage is greater than 19 then the level increment by 3, and so on and so forth.\nThe Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level is subtracted from any roll made with the corresponding resources.\n\nExample\nArinya has a Stress level of 2. She wants to make a Deception check, lying to her friends pretending that everything is ok.\nShe assembles her pool of dice and get to roll 2d6, but she will have to subtract her Stress level from the total.\nShe rolls 2d6 - 2 ;  she gets a 3 and a 4 on the dice for a total of  3 + 4 - 2 = 5 !\n\nCritical Success and Failure\nA critical success occurs when the total of the dice is double or more than the set difficulty.\nA critical failure on the other hand happens when the total roll is less than half of the set difficulty.\nPerception Checks\nPerception checks are always free. They use dice pools determined by the species of the character. (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/character-creation/character-creation-species/#443e3a\"> Character Creation - Species - Senses</a>)\nDiffiiculty (for GMs)\nTo set the difficulty of a skill, you can use this table :\n\nDifficulty\nscore\nnotes\n\nTrivial\n2+\nGaranteed succeess when either having a specialty or buying 1 die.\n\nVery Easy\n4+\n\nEasy\n6+\n\nMedium\n8+\nRoughly 50% chance of succees with 2d6 or 2d8 (at least 1 buy should be bought, signifying that a bit of effort must be put into the task. Alternatively, can sometimes be done effortlessly - without buyind dice - if the character has a specialty)\n\nHard\n12+\nRequired to have at least 1 rank in the skill to succeed (or be very lucky with a d12 attribute)\n\nVery Hard\n16+\n\nImpossible\n20+",

		"content": "Combat and Injuries\nCombat rules for <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/neldar-system/\">Neldar System</a>.\nCombat\nCombat start when a PC or an NPC does any action that the other party considers to be hostile. There are no surprised round, instead at any point during combat, a target can be unaware of its attacker. Every time a defendant is unaware of an attack, the difficulty of the check to Dodge / Deflect or Resist it is doubled.\nA target may be unaware of an attacker if it doesn't physically perceive it or if it doesn't think the attacker as potentially hostile.\nInitiative\nInitiative is always rolled at the moment an aggressive action is declared and before it is taken. Unaware targets might not take actions and simply skip their turn if they roll a better initiative than the instigator of the attack.\nInitiative is usually rolled with the Reaction Speed die. However, in specific situations an other attribute die can be used. For example, a duel between wizards might call for an initative roll with the Wits die.\nThe number of dice used is equal to the Fighting skill rank (minimum of 1). Once again, specific situations might use an other skills (with always a minumum of 1 die). A rogue trying to stay hidden might be able to use their Stealth skill instead.\n\nInitiative = Fighting d Reaction Speed\n\nSometimes it is also possible to roll Initiative with one of the Senses/Perception Pool. In the case of an ambush, the ambusehd partx might used one of their Senses as their Initiative Pool.\nCombat Turn\nCombatants take their turn in order of initiative. On their turn a combatant can take 2 Actions.\nAn Action is :\n\nMove (up to one's speed)\n\nStep\nCharge\n\nAttack\n\nGrapple (No damage, but reduces any speed to 0. - needs a free hand)\nShove (No damage but push the target 2m away - needs a free hand or shield)\nThrow (A character can throw a light weapon up to 2* their physics die in meters)\nTake Aim (Next ranged attack action will gain a free die of 1 category less)\nReload (Some weapons, like crossbows, need to be reloaded with 1 Action)\n\nAttack with an Instrument\n\nInsult (Sort of unarmed Instrument Attack, see below)\n\nHealing with an Instrument\nCast a spell (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/spells/\">Spells</a>)\n\nRemove 1 rune from a spell and add 1 rune to a spell.\n\nUse a special ability\nReady an Action (Readying an Action allows to act out of turn, but takes 2 Actions)\n\nOut of their turn a combattant can :\n\nAttack of Opportunity (need a special Feat to unlock, or a weapon with a special trait)\nDefend\n\nDeflect or Dodge a spell or attack.\nResist an attack or spell.\n\nAttack\nAn attack roll with a weapon works like a skill check on Fighting with Physics. It is not possible to make an attack with Reaction Speed or Pain Tolerance, except if a particular weapon allows it.\nThe total result of the attack roll will be used to set the difficulty for the defendant wether they want to Dodge or Resist the damage.\nOnce an attack is successful, the damage roll is defined by the weapon the attacker is wielding.\nUnarmed Attack : An unarmed physical attack is done like any attack, except its always deals 1 Bludgeoning Damage, unless the character possess a Feat that specify otherwise.\nInstrument Attack or Healing\nAn attack roll or healing with an Instrument is done using Perfomance on Charisma and resilience is used to buy the dice.\nWhen helaing the Difficulty is a set 12 that can be modified by the type or quality of the instrument.\nInsult : An insult can be seen as a sort of unarmed Instrument Attack. It is roll with Performance on Charisma and deals a fixed 1 Anxiety Damage on the Spirit. (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/combat-and-injuries/#173746\">Damage Types</a>). As with all Instrument Attacks, an Insult cannot be dodge only resisted. For this special case, if the target successfully Resists the insult all damage is negated.\nDeflecting or Dodging\nDeflecting or Dodging a spell or an attack by using dice from the appropriate Defense Pool (see below) will allow the combatant to completely negates all effects of the spell or the attack.\nDeflect / Dodge checks are always made on Wits, Reaction Speed or Insight / Manipulation and it is not possible to buy dice with an other resource.\nDodging a Body attack is always rolled with Fighting on Reaction Speed and only endurence can by use to buy dice from the Body Defense Pool.\nResisting\nResisting a spell or an attack by using dice from the appropriate Defense Pool (see below) will allow the combattant to halve any incoming damage and avoid additional effects or conditions.\nIn usual circomstances the defendant can choose to Dodge/Deflect or Resist the effects of an incoming attack unless the attack precise otherwise. A spellcaster can choose if their spell can be Deflected only, Resisted only or let the target choose. (see. <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/spells/#bdc950\">Spells</a>)\nResisting a Spirit attack is always rolled with Raw Magic on Volition and only resilience can by use to buy dice from the Spirit Defense Pool.\nCritical Success on Attacks\nWhen a character dodge / deflect or resisit an attack, if the total they rolled is strictly less than half of the Difficulty (the attacker's or caster's total roll), then it is considered to be a critical success for the attacker and all incoming damage are doubled. Double the damage before applying any Resistance or Vulnerability.\nDefense Pools\nEach character has three different Defense Pools, one for their Mind based on their Arcane Magic skill, one for Body based on their Fighting skill and one for their Spirit based on their Raw Magic skill.\nThe maximum of a Defense Pool is equal to the skill rank + 1. At the start of their turn a character's Defense Pools are reset to their respective maximums.\nWhenever a character is attacked during a round, they can choose to buy dice from their appropriate Defense Pool to try to Dodge / Deflect or Resist the attack (or spell). Dice bought this way are removed from the Pool until the start of the character next turn.\nThe first die is always free as well as any die granted by an eventual armour. The free dice are never removed from the Dice Pool.\nThe armour value for the Mind is called Ward and the armour value for the Spirit is called Veil.\nDual Wielding\nWhen a character is dual wielding weapons this enables them to make two attacks per Action, one with each weapons. However, the two attacks share the same dice pool based on the Fighting skill. Each attacks benefits from the free die and any speciality die any other die must be bought from the attack pool.\nThe attack pool is reset after each Action taken.\nDamage Type\n#damage_type\nEach damage type affects one part of the Being except for poison who can affect all three.\n\nMind (reduces focus)\nBody (reduces endurance)\nSpirit (reduces resilience)\n\nConfusion\nPiercing / Slashing\nFear\n\nOblivion\nBludgeoning / Force\nCharm\n\nPsychic\nFire / Heat / Lightning\nDespair\n\nCold / Freezing\nAnxiety\n\nAcid\n\nPoison\nPoison\nPoison\n\nResitances, Vulnerabilities and Immunities\n\nResistances, Vulnerabilities and Immunities are always linked to a damage type and usually granted by one's species or special feats.\nResistances and Vulnerabilites comes with a value, generally a dynamic one like &quot;Half your Body score&quot; or &quot;Equal to your level&quot;. When applying resistances and vulnerability the value is removed from the total damage (in the casse of resistances) or added to it (in the case of vulnerabilities) before the damage is applied to the character.\nImmunities reduce any damage of that type to 0.\n\nAyrina is a <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Peat Orc</a> an <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/species/orcs/\">Orc</a> Subspecies. . She gets a Bludgeoning Resistance equal to Half of her Body score thanks to her Species, but suffers from a Vulnerability to Fire equal to Half of her level rounded down (min 1).\nShe has a Body score of 8 and a level of 4.\nShe is attacks by someone using a Flamming Mace and failed her Dodge.\nHer opponent rolls the damage and get a result of 5 Bludgeoning + 2 Fire.\nHer Resistance to Bludgeoning has a value of (8/2 = 4), so she will only take 5 - 4 = 1 Bludgeoning damage.\nOn the other hand, her Vulnerability to Fire has a value of (4/2 = 2) so she will take 2 + 2 = 4 Fire damage.\n\nInjuries\n#Injuries, #injury, #Fatigue, #Exhaustion , #Stress\nEvery times someone does a task without the necessary resources to pay the cost of said task their Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level increases by 1, depending on the part of their Being the skill is associated with.\nIt is also the case if a creature takes damage on a resource (focus, endurance or resilience) which is already at 0.\nWork In Progress : unsure When a resource is at 0, only 1 additional die can be bought by incrementing the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress counter by 1.\nFree dice never increase those counters.\nIf the damage received are greater than 9 then the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level increments by 2, similarly if the cost or damage is greater than 19 then the level increment by 3, and so on and so forth.\nEvery time the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level of a creature increments it must roll on the corresponding Injury table.\nInjuries Rolltables\nA roll for an Injury is done in two steps. The first step will define if the Injury will be Temporary or Permanent. It is done by roll 1d6 and adding the corresponding Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level.\nA result of 7 or lower gives a Temporary Injury, any result strictly higher than 7 means that the Injury will be Permanent.\n\nAyrina has a Fatigue level of 2 and 0 point of focus left. She takes 14 Oblivion damage on her Mind incrementing her Fatigue level by an additional 2 (14 is greater than 9 so the level increases by 2).\nShe now has to roll 1d6 + 4, she rolled a 5 for a total of 5 + 4 = 9.\n9 being strictly greater than 7, she will suffer from a Permanent Mind Injury !\n\nTemporary Injuries\nTemporary injuries either heal with time or are easily healed with a commonly available treatment. They impart some handicaps on the creature until they are healed.\nPermanent Injuries\nPermanent injuries are either very hard to heal or cannot be healed at all. Their handicaps are permanent and the creature must learn to live with them the best they can.\nAdvices for Game Masters - Storytellers : If a character suffer from an Injury due to damage, you can tell them to roll on the rolltable, but you are not forced to use the result as the Injury as is. Don't hesitate to modify or create new Injuries linked to the type or damage or situation the characters find themselves in.\nA paralytic poison will probably have different lasting effects than a burn or a broken bone.\nNote on Creatures\nTo simplify combat, creature controlled by the game masters don't get injuries. They will instead die as soon as either their focus, endurance or resilience reach 0.\nWhen a creature drops to 0 in a resource due to something else than damage (while attacking or defending) the creature doesn't die immediately, but enters a weaken state where they can not use abilities that cost them more than 1 of this resource.\nDeath\nAt any moment, if the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level of a character goes above 6 the character dies.\nDeath is permanent, resurrection magic doesn't exist in this world.",

The player and the GM define together what would be the magical item and its effect(s). The phase can also be done by the GM exclusively.\nThat's also the phase when the GM can veto any idea that would not fit the narrative or the universe.\nInformation Gathering\nThe second phase is were the characters start to get involved. The player describe what steps their character take to gather information or what experiment they conduct to better learn how to make the item.\nThe GM then ask for the relevant checks. Depending on the success of those checks, the GM will give a recipe for the magic item. If a character fails all of their research checks while trying to learn how to make a flame sword the GM might give them the recipe for a frost sword instead. (The GM is encouraged to always give something to the character, but more fails lead to a recipe further away from what the character initially wanted to achieve.)\nIngredients Gathering\nThis phase is pretty self explanatory, the characters set off on a mission to gather all of the required ingredients.\nThe more potent the planned item, the rarer the ingredient and more difficult to gather.\nCrafting\nOnce all the necessary information and ingredients gathered the character(s) can start the crafting process. The GM will ask for the relevant checks. The better the result the stronger the item. If some of those checks fail, the item will still have the basic potency describe by the information given during the Information Gathering phase, but might have some negative effects added to it.\nA poorly crafted flame sword might have the added risk of burning its wielder adding a 25% chance of taking 1d4 Fire damage after every hit.",

The maximum of each resource cannot be higher than two times its corresponding Fundamental Value.\nCompetence Check\nLinked to Mind, Body or Spirit are multiple Competences. Each one has a name, a score and a Cost. Every time a creature try to do something that has the potential of failing, a Competence check is made.\nFirst add the score value of the Competence to the Ability that will be used. Each Competence has a default Ability, but in some cases an other Ability might be more appropriate. If a creature wants to throw its dagger with as much force as possible the ability used will be Physic, if on the other hand, the creature wants to carefully aim for a specific target then the Ability used would be Coordination. (A case could be made for the use of Senses if the success of this check depend on the creature successful perceiving the location of its target.)\nThe Fundamental value is added along with any circumstantial bonuses or maluses in order to obtain the final score.\nThe creature then roll 1d100, the check is a success if the result of the roll is less or equal to the final score of the Competence.\n\nExemple :\nArinya wants to translate a stone tablet written in Ancient Laugsuil.\nThe GM tells Arinya's player that the check will be on Education, because the only time Arinya was exposed to Ancient Laugsuil was during her school days.\nHer competence in Ancient Laugsuil is 5, her Education is 8 and her Mind is 6 this gives her a final score of 5+8+6 = 19.\nArinya's player roll 1d100 and gets a 89. It's a failure.\nArinya spend 1 hour and 1 focus trying to translate the tablet but does not achieve her goal.\n\nCost, #Fatigue, #Exhaustion and #Stress\nEach Competence has a cost in its corresponding resource (focus, endurance or resilience). For each action that is not instantaneous, like shooting a bow or trying to dodge or parry an attack, their cost is counting for up to 1 hour, if the activity last longer than 1 hour, the cost must be paid again.\nA task cost must be paid whether or not the it is successful.\nIt is still possible to do a task with no resources left, but this will instead increment the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level and prompt a roll on the corresponding Injury table. (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/old-v1-rules/combat-and-injuries-v1/#5a0385\">Injuries</a>)\nEasy success and Effortless success\nWhen you roll below half of your score you get an easy success and the cost of the task your were doing is divided by 2. If you roll below a fifth of your score, you get an effortless success and the cost of the task is reduced to 1.",

There are no surprised round, instead if the target is unaware of its attacker, the attack gain a +30 unaware bonus. If the target tries to parry or dodge, it will also suffer a malus of -30.\nA target may be unaware of an attacker if it doesn't physically perceive it or if it doesn't think the attacker as potentially hostile.\nInitiative\nBefore the #initiative is rolled, the #readiness of each creature is calculated. On the VTT the formula is the following.\nReadiness\n\nReadiness = ((your current focus / your max focus ) + ( your current endurance/ your max endurance) + (your current resilience /your max resilience) ) / 3 )* 100 rounded down.\n\nHowever it is a daunting calculation to do by hand every time a combat start.\nAn alternate formula for readiness is to simply add your current focus, endurance and resilience together.\nReadiness Alternate\n\nReadiness = current focus + current endurance + current resilience\n\nTo get your initiative score, roll a 1d100 and substract to result from your readiness. Also substract your fatigue, exhaustion and stress levels.\nInitiative score\n\nReadiness - [1d100] - fatigue level - exhaustion level - stress level\n\nCombat Turn\nCombatants take their turn in order of initiative. On their turn a combatant can :\n\n#Attack\nCast a spell (see <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Spells (v1)</a>)\nUse a special ability\n\nWhen a defendant is attacked they can choose to #Parry or #Dodge once before their next turn.\nAttack\nAn attack is almost like a normal check using the competence appropriate for the weapons the combatant is currently wielding. Additionally, the armour value of the target is substracted from the competence value.\nDodge\nSimilarly, dodging uses the Dodge competence to which the doge malus of any equipped shield or armour is substracted.\nParry\nParrying simply uses the competence associated with the weapons the combatant is currently wielding.\nDual Wielding\n#dual_wielding\nYou can have one weapon in each hand, doing so allows you to attack with both your weapons during you turn however you suffer a penalty of -30 on both attacks and can not use the specials capacities of your weapons linked to the One Handed Weapon Competence. You can however use the specials capacities of your weapons linked to the Dual Wielding Competence.\nDamage Type\n#damage_type\nEach damage type affects one part of the Being except for poison who can affect all three.\n\nMind (reduces focus)\nBody (reduces endurance)\nSpirit (reduces resilience)\n\nConfusion\nPiercing / Slashing\nFear\n\nOblivion\nBludgeoning / Force\nCharm\n\nPsychic\nFire / Heat / Lightning\nDespair\n\nCold / Freezing\nAnxiety\n\nAcid\n\nPoison\nPoison\nPoison\n\nInjuries\n#Injuries, #injury, #Fatigue, #Exhaustion , #Stress\nEvery times someone does a task without the necessary resources to pay the cost of said task their Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level increments by 1, depending on the part of their Being the competence is associated with.\nIt is also the case if a creature takes damage on a resource (focus, endurance or resilience) which is already at 0.\nIf the cost of the task or the damage received are greater than 9 then the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level increments by 2, similarly if the cost or damage is greater than 19 then the level increment by 3, and so on and so forth.\nEvery time the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level of a creature increments it must roll on the corresponding Injury table.\nTemporary Injuries\nTemporary injuries either heal with time or are easily healed with a commonly available treatment. They impart some maluses on the creature until they are healed.\nPermanent Injuries\nPermanent injuries are either very hard to heal or cannot be healed at all. There maluses are permanent and the creature must learn to live with them the best they can.\nNote on Creatures\nTo simplify combat, creature don't get injuries. They will instead die as soon as etheir their focus, endurance or resilience reach 0. To compensate for this fact, creature have 3 time their Fubdamental score in resource maximum. (ie. a creature with a Body score of 6 will have 18 endurance max instead of the 12 that a character would get.)\nDeath\nAt any moment, if the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level of a character goes above 6 the character dies.\nDeath is permanent, resurrection magic doesn't exist in this world.",

If the player wants to throw a die to decide, that's fine, but the internal will of the character must be decided by the player, not the gm.\nIntelligence Saves\nUsually when Psychic damage is involved. Use the focus instead. Reduce the focus by a given or rolled amount and once the focus hits 0 give appropriate Injuries.\nCharsima Saves\nTo resist a magical effect -&gt; Raw magic check\nDeath Saves\nThose don't exist !\nOnce a character reaches 0 focus, endurance or resilience they start accumulating injuries, if they ever reach more than 6 levels of fatigue, exhaustion or stress they die. That's it, their story is over.\nClasses and class abilities\nClasses don't exist, instead player create their own specialisation by choosing the competences that their character has trained.\nClass abilites are somewhat replaced by weapons special traits.

A character can have up to 3 inspiration tokens at the same time.\n\n1 inspiration token can be use to re-roll the latest die rolled by the character.\n2 inspiration tokens can be used to make an NPCs or any creature controlled by the GM re-rolled their latest die.\n\nImportant : Inspiration tokens cannot be traded between players ! If a player feel like an other should be rewarded for their RP, they can ask the GM to give that player a token but they cannot give a token of their own.\nSpecial case : when a d100 is rolled, an inspiration token can be used to re-roll the full d100, only the digit die or only the tens die.\n\nExample :\nArinya is trying to hit a monster with her rapier. Her total score for One Handed Weapons adds up to 27.\nArinya's player roll 1d100 and gets a 28. It would be a failure, but Arinya has one inspiration token that was previously given by the Game Master. To maximize their odd of sucesse, Arinya's player decide to use their inspiration token to re-roll only the digit die. They roll 1d10 and this time gets a 4. The final result is a 24 which is under 27 and therefore a success !\n\nLevel up\nWhen the group as a whole accomplishes something significant, overcomes an obstacle or otherwise undergoes some kind of growth, the GM can reward each member of the group with a new level.\nEach level, a character gains a number of points decided by the GM to spend in their Fundamentals (2 by default).\nThey also gain points (3 by default) to spend in their abilities and some (20 by default) to spend in their competences.\nLearning new competences\nWhile leveling up a player can only spend points in competences that their character already knows. Spending points in a new competence requires the character to have found a way to learn it. Finding books about a subject, a teacher or starting to spend time training with an other player character are all valid ways to learn a new competence.",

A Persuasion task would usually cost 2 resilience, but that would increase her stress level. She however still has almost all of her focus left today.\nSo she decide to try the Persuasion task while pushing through, paying 4 focus instead of the 2 resilience.\n\nAddictions\nSome Resourcing Activities might have a risk of #Addiction. The Addiction risk must be defined at the creation of the Activity by the player and the GM.\nIf a character indulge in such an activity at a frequency equal or above the risk frequency of the activity, they must roll an addiction check.\nThe player roll 1d100 and if the result is higher than the addiction threshold of the activity - the number of days they have been partaking in the activity, they fail the check and become addicted.\n\nsuccess if 1d100 &lt; =addiction threshold - number of day\n\nWhen a character is addicted to an activity, this activity stops being a Resourcing Activity for them (they gain no benefice, but still have to pay the cost) and it becomes an additional Needs.

The player rolls 1d100 if the result is higher than the addiction potential minus the number of days they have been in withdrawal then they fail the check and must seek out the fastest way to partake in the addictive activity again.\n\n1d100 &lt;= addiction threshold + number of day in withdrawal\n\nThe circumstances and their modifiers on a relapse check are as follow :\n\nDescription\nPenalty\n\nPeriodical check\nSome activities ask for a periodical relapse check during withdrawal.\n0\n\nIdea check\nWhen something in the environment of the character reminds them of the activity\n-10\n\nTemptation check\nWhen the opportunity to partake in the activity is directly presented to the character.\n-30\n\nOf course the GM and players are encouraged to find creative alternative ways to cure a character's addiction. They might want to try to get rid of their drinking habit by instead going for a walk with a friend or finding a new hobby.

Once a Rest is done everyone check their needs and whether or not they have fulfilled them. Each need is linked to one part of the Being and will dictate which recovery die will be rolled. If a need is unmet, the recovery die for the specific resource will be one category lower (a 1d6 would become a 1d4).\nThe result of the recovery die is added to the current value of the resource.\n\nNeed\nPart of the Being\nResource\n\nSunlight\nMind\nFocus\nFatigue\n\nFood and water\nBody\nEndurance\nExhaustion\n\nSleep and/or Dream\nSpirit\nResilience\nStress\n\nAfter each rest, the values of fatigue, exhaustion and stress level are divided by 2 (rounded down.)\nFor each need that was not fulfiled, the fatigue, exhaustion or stress value is only decremented by 1.\n\nAyrina has a Mind score of 3, Body score of 5 and a Spirit score of 4. Her recovery dice are 2d6, 2d8 and 2d6 respectively.\nShe had spent the day exploring dark caves and passages, thus her need for sunlight was not met, but she had plenty to eat and was able to sleep.\nThis means that she will roll her full dice for her endurance (Body) and resilience (Spirit) : 2d8 and 2d6, but for her focus (Mind) she will only be able to roll 2d4 (1 category of die less than her recovery dice of 2d6).\nAt the end of the day she had : 5 focus, 4 endurance and 6 resilience. In the morning she will roll her recovery dice and regain :\nMind : 2d4, she gets a total of 3 her new value of focus for the day is 8.\nBody : 2d8, she gets a total of 9 her new value of endurance for the day is 13.\nSpirit : 2d6, she gets a total of 7 her new value of resilience for the day is 12. (She cannot go over her resilience maximum which is 3 times her Spirit socre : 12)\n\nResourcing Activities\n#Resourcing_Activity\nSome activities can replenish one resource for some cost. The cost can be other resources, time or simply money. Each resourcing activity is personal to each character, their cost and benefit may vary from character to character.\nOne character might be greatly helped focusing by drinking coffee, but not really tolerate the acidity of the beverage thus gaining a +1d4 focus and a -2 endurance when drinking a cup.\nAn other one might tolerate the acidity well but becoming a little bit agitated gaining a +1d4 to focus and a -2 to resilience.\nA nice walk in nature might gives you a +1d4 to resilience and a +2 to focus while costing you only 2 endurance, but to complete this activity you need at least 1 hour and access to nature or a park.\n\nAdvice for GMs\nAs the adventure progress it is advised to emphasis to your players the discovery or creation of new Resourcing Activities for their characters. Activities that help them with their Permanent Injuries and tie into their character's narrative arc.\nThe idea of this game is to keep going, healing what can be healed and learning to manage what cannot.",

It is the type of magic the Player Characters can have access to if they choose to.\nA practitioner of magic can only have a limited number of active spells at any given time. This number is dictated by their rank in the Arcane Magic skill.\n\nNumber of parallel spells = Arcane Magic Rank\n\nSpells are constructed by combining different runes together.\nRunes\nThere exists 6 different type of runes :\n\nVerb : Will inform how the spell will interact with the world.\n\nDamage : Will do damage depending on the Element and the Potency runes\nHinder : Will Hinder the Target(s) in some way. The exact effects depend on the Element rune.\nProtect : Will Protect the Target(s) against something.\nEnhance : Will Enhance an ability of the Target(s).\nHeal : Will Heal the Target(s) in some way.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Element</a> : Different Elements will synergise differently depending on the verb used. Doing damage of this Element when combined with a Damage verb rune or protecting against it when combine with a Protect verb rune.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Potency</a> : The number and type of dice rolled or a raw value. Can differ depending on the verb used.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Range</a> (optional) : How far away from yourself can you put the origin point of the spell. If not provided the spell can only be cast on oneself.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Target</a> : The number of creatures that can be targeted or the area of effect of the spell.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Sustain</a> (optional) : For a spell to last more than the number of turns provided, a Sustain rune is needed. The type of Sustain can be Active, requiring an action to be kept active, Passive only requiring the sustain cost to be paid, but no action or Movable allowing the use of an action to move the spell somewhere else in range. The sustain cost is the amount of focus that the spellcaster must pay to keep the spell active. It can be 5, 2 or 1 focus. If a spellcaster takes damages while sustaining a spell, they must succeed a Resist check to be able to keep it.\n\nDifficulty\nIn addition to its type and value, each runes also has a difficulty cost. The sum of the difficulty cost of the runes will dictate the total difficulty of the spell. The caster must roll equal or higher than that number to successfully cast the spell.\nThe number the caster rolled will be the difficulty for anyone trying to Deflect or Resist the spell effects.\nThe target can choose to Deflect or Resist the effects of the spell unless the caster increase the total spell Difficulty by 1 to force the target to Deflect or by 2 to force the target to Resist.\nSome runes might also have a prerequisite. This prerequisite represent the minimum rank in Arcane Magic that a spellcaster must have to be able to use this rune.\nRaw Magic\n#raw_magic\nRaw magic is the type of magic based on instinct and emotions. That's the type of magic used by creatures that are naturally magical. Raw magic, by nature is less structured and almost unpredictable.\n(It is an excuse for the GM to do whatever they what with creatures abilities ;) )",

On their twelve birthday, when they choose their apprenticeship, their master give them their adult name.\nOnly nobles have a family name.\nGenerally, consonant are followed by a vowel, with the notable exception of the &quot;nr&quot; and &quot;rn&quot; group.\nMasculine names tends to finish in &quot;-ro&quot; or &quot;-or&quot; (&quot;-or&quot; being the mark of an older name).\nFeminine names tends to finish in &quot;-a&quot;, &quot;-te&quot; or &quot;-i&quot; (with &quot;-i&quot; being the ancient ending).\nRecently, people in the East of Nelatar started using the ending &quot;-an&quot; as a gender neutral ending for names.\nPeople in the West and in the Temple still understand this ending as a masculine one though.\nCurrency\nThe Nelataran currency is the daer.

There siege is found in the capital city of the Western Province, Ordelen.\nThey are lead by the Grand Priest and his two advisors his Right and Left Hands. It is rumoured that the Left Hand of the Grand Priest is nothing more than his personal assassin, though sometime the position has been used by Grand Priest to keep a political enemy in check. The Left Hand having close to no actual power as opposed to the Right Hand.\nThe Temple is firmly opposed to the Masked Ones, a group of people that started to appear less than a century ago in the East. The Masked One tried to re-awaken the ancient beliefs in multiples divine powers, slowly undermining the authority of the Temple.\nThe Temple made it illegal to even pronounce the names of the ancient gods.\nThe colours of Ordel, and by extension the Temple, are the white and light blue.\nEvery Priest and apprentice receives a light blue cape from the Temple, upon their ordination.\nFolklore\nThree Hags\nThree old women in the wilderness are considered to be hags.

The Church wants to take the lake Taenaelin under their control since it's a holy site of their faith.\nSince the Orc birthrate is roughly 3 males for 1 female, every male Orc has to prove himself in battle before earning the right to get a wife.\nMale Orcs have also the choice to enter the service of the Church where they can also &quot;earn&quot; a wife if their elders deemed them devoted enough.\nThe Menelhîn is the name the Aranlindir of Rhuk give themselves. Without their knowledge, the Orcs &quot;clip&quot; the wings of every Aranlindir newborn as soon as they've hatched.\nWithout cutting their wings entirely, they cut the main muscle rendering them incapable of flight for their entire life.\nThe Menelhîn culture has been almost entirely erased by the Church of Kâtha-Attû, but the Aranlindir have developed a secret way to communicate with each other.\nA secret language called Linifir composed of chirps and clicks that the Orcs mistake for meaningless bird songs.\nIn this language they tell each other how they are the children of the sky and once were flying high above the lands and the sea and they address prayers to their ancestral father Roval and their ancestral mother Tuilinn.\nThe Zînâhin\nThe Zînâhin is an organisation started be Orc women and non-binary to oppose the Church of Kâtha-Attû.\nThey share tales of their forgotten goddess Zînâ (sometime called Zîrîna) and secretly practice rituals in her honour.\nThe Zînâhin quickly started to accept Orc men in their numbers, any who oppose the current rule of the Church or the Patriarchy is welcomed. What started as religious rebellion has become a political fight.\nLanguages\nThe official language of Rhuk is Rhukethet, but the multiple communities of Dwarves often still speak Zondolk (or even sometime Ondolk).\nThe Aranlindir speak and sing Linifir and the isolated Gnolls villages speak Gnewic.\nCalendar\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/cultures/calendars/rhuk-calendar/\">Rhuk Calendar</a>",
