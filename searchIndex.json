In the morning of their 4th day here, they will be awaken by the cries of Fidala Avarami, who found her husband (Daetor Avaro) dead outside.\nA little before the adventure's start, Sila met three hags disguised as old ladies. The hags pretended to need help and rewarded Sila with a magic iron-like ring that would allow Sila to communicate directely with one the hags, Moelle (Annis Hag). The ring is an Iron Token (see Iron Token under the Info section of the Annis Hag)\nMoelle has been talking to Sila through the ring, acting as a kind and empathetic grandmother, but in actuallity, slowly corrupting her.\nMoelle Annis Hag is part of a coven with two other hags Miasme Green Hag and Engelure Bheur Hag.\nEngelure has been casting Control Weather every day in the morning for 3 days (or more, if you wish the PCs to have been stuck inside for longer) in order to make travel impossible.\nThe Night of the Murder\nSila, pushed by the whispers of Moelle is the one who murdered Daetor.\nDaetor was dismissive and treating her like she did not even exist and Sila slowly grow resentful.\nShortly after the unatural blizzard stranded the group inside, Daetor caught a nasty cold, fearing that it could take a turn for the worst, Erkano was preparing some herbal medicine for Daetor to take, Sila was often the one to bring it to him in the evening.\nIn the evening of the third day, Sila added some monkshood (Aconitum ) to Daetor's potion.\nSymptoms\n\nnausea\nvomitting\ndiarrhea\nsweating\ndizziness\ndifficulty in breathing\nheadache\nconfusion\n\nDaetor, due to those symtoms, woke up Fidala in the middle of the night. He had diffculty breathing and said he had a headache and needed some fresh air. He stumbled with difficulty down the stairs, which woke up Quicksilver.\nSila, waiting for her moment, was hidding in the common room. She followed Daetor outside and tried to stab him with a knife from the kitchen while he was in a weaken state, she left the knife in the wound and quickly went back to her and Erkanro's room.\nLeaving the knife in the wound, is what allowed Sila to flee without having any blood on her. The wound still bled after, meaning that Daetor was still alive when stabbed.\nPost Mortem\n\nSigns of diarrhea\nKnife wound in the back, with the knife stuck in it, did not do any lethal damage.\nBlood from the wound still soaked his clothes ; he was alive when stabbed\nNothing was heard from inside the refuge ; he did not call for help or at least not with enough strength to wake up the people inside.\nCyanosis (due to asphyxia and frostbites) His fingertips, toes and lips are blue.\nThe cause of death was paralysis of the hearth and respiratory center causing asphyxia (Can only be confirmed via a Wish spell or a Divine Intervention)\n\nSpeak with Dead\nIf the spell Speak with Dead is used Daetor can reveal the following information (if asked !):\n\nHis potion was bitter this time\nHe was feeling too hot and dizzy, he woke up during the middle of the night and need to go get some fresh air and use the bathroom...\nHe felt something when outside like he stumble into somebody, but saw nobody there.\nIt was harder and harder to breathe\nHe was still sweating despite the cold, in fact he was not feeling the cold anymore...\n\nBoth Ekanro and Nerena are in possession of monkshood, both possess various plants that can be used in herbal medicine or in poisoning (rulewise Ekanro has a Herbalism Toolkit and Nerena a Poisoner Toolkit) to recognise that Nerena has specifically a poisoner toolkit and not an herbalism one, a character must either be part of the Masked Ones or be a Rogue and succeed a DC 15 Survival or Nature check.\n\n[!gm] Ekanro's Herbalism kit\nRosemary\nValerian\nSt John's Wort\nMullein\nChamomille\nMonkshood\nSolomon's seal\n\n[!gm] Nerena's Poisoner kit\nHemlock\nValerian\nBelladona\nMullein\nMonkshood\nApple Seeds\n\nClues\nDaetor was poisoned before being stabbed and the poison was the cause of death\n\nHe complained to his wife that the potion was bitter this time (Fidala)\nThe knife wound was not lethal (DC 15 Medicine check or DC 20 Survival check, fighters or rogues have a DC of 5 less than other characters)\nHe had difficulty breathing when he woke up in the middle of the night and complain of a headache and needing fresh air (Fidala)\nQuicksilver saw him struggling to get down the stairs and acting confused (Quicksilver, needs Speak with Animals)\n\nSila is the poisoner\n\nShe was the one bringing the potion to Daetor\nThe knife stab was done be someone with low strength and smaller than Daetor (DC 25 Survival check, rogue have a DC of 5 less)\nQuicksilver saw her following Daetor outside (Speak with animals and a DC 25 Persuasion or Deception check) Quicksilver will admit seeing someone following Daetor outside, the check is needed for him to tell that it was Sila as he wants to protect her. He doesn't believe that she has the strength to kill Daetor and sees her as a &quot;kitten&quot;.\nSila herself seems worried and can be seen &quot;talking to herself&quot; while fiddlelling with her iron ring. (She is actually talking to Moelle through the Iron Token)\n\nHags are involved\n\nThe weather is unatural (DC 10 Nature or Survival check, automatic success for druids or rangers)\nSila's ring is magical (Detect Magic or DC 15 Arcana check, only magic users can make this check)\nSila's ring is not made of iron and will not repel Fey creatures. (She says and believes that her ring is made of iron and is a lucky charm to protect her against evil feys... hags do love irony) (DC 10 for any character with Smith Tools Proficiency, based on Intelligence or Wisdom)\nSpeaking with the Banshee near the well (see below) will reveal that hags are living in the vicinity.\nIf interogated about her iron ring, Sila will mention meeting three old women in the wilderness. Anyone from the East of Nelatar or Egerot knows this saying :\n\n[!gm] Three Old Women\n&quot;One old woman in the wood : A healer gathering herbs to heal you.\nTwo old women in the wood : A couples of gossipers talking about you.\nThree old women in the wood : No women but hags, that will gleefuly hurt you.&quot;\n\nIn case your party is low level and you want to use only one hag use this one instead\n\n[!gm] Three Old Women\n&quot;Three women in the wood are here for gossip.\nTwo women in the wood, it's the healer and her apprentice.\nOne woman in the wood, it's a hag ! prepare for hardship...&quot;\n\nPeople from the West of Nelatar and therefore who have lived under a more stronger influence of the Temple of Ordel (Ekanro and Sila both are from this demographic) have never heard of this saying as it is seen by the Temple as relating to older beliefs and therefore forbidden.\nThe Well and the Singing\nEvery night, the PCs can hear beautiful but sorrowful singing from the well. This song is coming from Nimwen a Banshee that was tricked by the same group of hags a long time ago. If the PCs talk to her and are decently polite they can learn the story of her death and therefore learn about the hags. (If they antagonise her in any way the Banshee will attack them and the group will learn nothing)\n\n[!gm] Nimwen's Story\nYoung and beautiful elf lost in the mountains and slowly dying of exposure.\nShe was found by three hags. The hags, cackling, asked her what she would give to not die young.\n&quot;Anything !&quot;, she answered.\n&quot;Such a beautiful and proud creature you are, but still you would rather die old and decrepit like we are ? &quot;\n&quot;Yes, yes I'd rather die old and decrepit ! Please help me !&quot;\nThe hags then stole away her youthfulness and her beauty and left her to die in the snow.\n\nNPCs' secrets\nThose secrets can be uncovered while the PCs interrogate the travellers, don't hesitate to give to your PCs some secrets of their own too !\nDaetor Avaro\nFull of himself, he loves power and being in control.\nHe was declared a Coward by the Princ of Nelatar. He awaits imprisonnement in Nelataren and judgement by the Prince. He may face execution.\nFidal Avarami\nShe lived a sheltered life and doesn't understand the struggles of people who are not of noble birth, but she is open to learn and has a kind hearth.\nShe is horrified at the death of her husband even if she did not love him.\nShe has an affair with Dagan.\nDagan\nThey have served Daetor and his family for most of their life. Daetor used to make fun of them and their &quot;feminine ways&quot;. They stayed in his service despite the humiliations, because they have been having an affair with Fidala.\nNerena\nShe is not a human, but an <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/species/essedir/\">Esseret</a> (Yuan-ti). She is a member of the <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Masked Ones</a> and a worshiper of the <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Black Snake</a>.\nShe wants to end the corrupt &quot;reign&quot; of the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/places/nelatar/#b8e726\">Temple of Ordel</a>. She had orders to kill Ekanro the Laft Hand, but she decided to hold her hand when she learnt that he has been excommunicated.\nHer reasoning being that she was ordered to kill &quot;Ekanro the Left Hand&quot; not &quot;Ekanro the Wandering Priest&quot;.\nEkanro\nFormer Left Hand of the High Priest of Ordel, he was excommunicated by the Temple.\nHe wants to go back to the roots of the priest-healers and help the common people.\nHe still hold some prejudices against the Masked Ones, but is starting to recognised that they are helping the common people more than the current priests of the Temple.\n\n[!gm] The Left Hand\nThe High Priest of Ordel holds more power than the Prince of Nelatar himself. The High Priest of Ordel traditionally choose two men as advisors The Right Hand and the Left Hand. As where the Right Hand acts as a public figure for the Hight Priest and enjoy his fair share of autonomy and power, the Left Hand is often tasked with more dirty work. The position has barely any practical power at all and was often used by High Priest to keep a political opponent in check.\nYou can choose if Ekanro was named to this position as a way to stripped him from power or if he was tasked to conduct some morally questionable deeds.\nThe important thing is that Ekanro eventually rebelled against this system and got himself excommunicated.\n\nSila\nOrphan from the street of Ordelen, she was taken in by the Temple and treated as a slave.\n(In their effort to &quot;Empty the streets of Ordelen from the sad view of children without homes&quot; the Temple used them as free labour for various tasks, mainly in helping building and maintaining the various temples of the city.)\nRealising the horrible conditions the orphan was living in, Ekanro took her as an apprentice.\nEkanro is the only person who show her kindness so far and the only one she trusts.\nWhen she became apprentice priest-healer, she was given a nice light blue cloak (as the custom wants it), but the Temple refused to replace her rags with better clothes. Furious, Ekanro spoke out during the ceremony and this is the inciting incident that lead to his excommunication and Sila and him adopting a humble nomadic lifestyle as itinerant healers.\n(Sila still doesn't have better clothes, because Ekanro had to pay the Temple heavy fine for even being allowed to leave...)\nSince helping the three old ladies in the wood, Sila has been talking to her iron ring seeing in Moelle the mother figure that she lacks.\nArlas and Quicksilver\nThey are the travellers guide. They know the region quite well, because they belive that there is a portal to the <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Dusk World</a> somewhere in the mountains. They are looking for it and have spend a significant amount of time axploring the mountains.\nThe have a snow leopard beast companion named Quicksilver.\nStatblocks\n\nNimwen Banshee\nMoelle Annis Hag\nEngelure Bheur Hag\nMiasme Green Hag\n\nTravellers\n\nArlas Ranger Beast Master level 5 Quicksilver is their Beast Companion\nNerena Rogue Assassin level 5\nFidala, Dagan, Ekanro and Sila (Commoners)\n\nPossible Endings\nThe PCs find the correct culprit and understand that hags are truely behind it all.\nThe PCs can decided to go fins the hag coven or the hags themselves come to the refuge when the PCs confront Sila.\nThe hags are contantly listening through the Iron Token and watching the PCs through various other magical means (Scrying, Hag Eye ) and can arrive at the most (in)convenient moment...\nDepending on your PCs group and abilities the hags can be in a coven or not and can have a lair in the region or not.\nFor low level PCs consider replacing the three hags by only one.\nThe PCs find the correct culprit but don't understand that hags are involved.\nThe adults of the group (PCs + NPCs) can decide together what fate should befall Sila. The NPCs all have their personal beliefs, but will easily go with the decision of the PCs, except if the PCs want to execute Sila here and there, this will start a fight with at least Arlas, Quicksilver and Nerena with the hags (or only one hag depending on the PCs level) arriving 1 round after the fight start (Sila used the Iron Token to ask for their help).\nIf the PCs decide on any other fate for Sila, the hags will take her away during the next night. (Miasme will use Invisible Passage and/or Illusory Appearance, Engelure can use her Graystaff to fly)\nSila can then be found in the hags' lair, if the PCs don't go rescue her, she will grow up to become a hag herself.\nThe PCs don't find the correct culprit and accuse someone else.\nFrankly, this should not happen, you should try to give enough clues that your PCs can at least partially piece out what happened. Don't hesitate to have NPCs give the information the PCs need if the latter are completely stuck.\n\nArlas could come to the PCs saying that they talk with Quicksilver and reveal some of the information Quicksilver has.\nNerena could say that she knows that some of the herbs and plants used by priest-healer could potentially also be used as poison.\nDagan could say that Daetor was not treating Sila according to her rank (priest-healer apprentice) and that it seemd to get to the poor girl. They also noticed that she has been talking to herself when she thought she was alone.\n\nIf the PCs still accuse Dagan and/or Fidala\nEkanro will leave the group, taking Sila with him not wanting to have anything to do with murderers, but not wanting to push the matter any further. He will declare that their own guilty conscience will be their punishment. The mountains having proven impassable, he will try to go back to Nelatar only for Sila to disapear two days after Ekanro and her left the group.\nArlas will agree to keep guiding Fidala and Dagan to Alfir. They know that Sila was the murderer, Quicksiler told them about seeing Sila during the night of the murder, but they won't say anything. They did not like Daetor anyways...\nNerena doesn't really care. She will go back to Serna as soon as the weather clears.\nDagan and Fidala will insist on their innocence, if the PCs push the matter, Fidala, as the current owner of their contract, will dismiss them without paying them and ask them to leave them alone.\nIf the PCs insist on killing Dagan and/or Fidala on the spot the gleeful cackle of the hags can be heard as the PCs commit murder themselves.\n&quot;Killers, Murderers, you who have taken innocent lives come join the dance ! &quot; The hags will then appear and dance around them to taunt them ! (If the PCs attack the hags, don't hold back, try to kill them, at this point they deserve it !)\nIf the PCs accuse Ekanro\nSila will intervene and reveal the truth, she doesn't want Ekanro to be accused and pay in her place in the end.\nIf the PCs accuse Arlas or Nerena\nBoth of them will feint compliance only to try to flee at the first opportunity.\nIf the PCs kill one of them then the hags will join in as in the paragraph above if the PCs kill Dagan and/or Fidala.",

He always has a pot of honey ready for his niece Odessa when she comes to visit him and he gives her flowers depending on the season. People who were closer to him often thought that he was depressed because he was alone, not married and without kids. That was absolutely not the case.

Digging through the rocky hills would take weeks or even month, but they have sent a messenger back to the city of Inrast to request enough black powder to make explosives.\nBefore the adventure start\nGive to each of your players' character at least one magic item. You can give them one from this list : <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/adventures/the-archeologists/the-archeologists-magic-items/#8ccebd\">Starting Items</a> or give them some more personalised ones. You can even ask them to come up with a magic item of their own.\nAsk them how they came in possession of their item and what they did with it. Let them sell it if they want and potentially buy something else with the money they made. (Give them around 1'000 and 2'000 gp for the item and let them buy any weapon +1 or leather armour / studded leather armour +1 or anything else of similar power).\nIf the PCs are level 1\nJust before arriving on the site they will encounter a Gnoll hunter and two Hyenas\nLet your PCs gain a level after the fight so they are level 2 for the rest of the adventure.\nUnsafe Rest\nFrom this point in the adventure, if the group decide to take a Long Rest in an unguarded and unsafe place, roll 4d20 per night, if any of the roll is a 5 or less they are attacked by three Giant Scorpions [Adaptation for level 2s : only 1 Giant Scorpion attacks the sleeping PCs]\nRival group encampment\nAn encampment of square and rectangular tents guarded by 3 visible <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/species/behemes/\">Behemes</a> (Giffs) with black powder weapons.\nSome <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Boscides</a> (Loxodons) can be seen inside a tent, taking notes. Magically sensitive PCs will know that the <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Boscides</a> are probably spellcasters.\nThe guards will intercept the PCs before they can get into the camp and tell them that this area is dangerous and that they need to leave.\nIf the PCs insist or mention the Society of Archeology, the guards will tell them that the Society has no power here and that they are here under the orders of Lord Barnnon.\nAny PC who has spent a decent amout of time in Inrats, knows who Lord Barnnon is. A rich and moderetely influencal noble of the city, who has an interest in &quot;ancient technologies and artefacts&quot;. He possess an impressive personal collection and is constantly at odds with the Society of Archeolgy. Members of the Society call him &quot;the grave robber with clean hands&quot; since he delegate all of the dirty work to mercenaries.\nThe PCs can try to snoop around during the night. If they are caught they are firmly ecorted aoutside of the camp after being searched for stolen document or black powder.\nIf the PCs are caught a second time, this will start a fight. If they win, the mercenaries will stripped them of all of their possessions, knock them out and leave them in the desert to die.\nNotes and letters in the encampment reveal the following information :\n\nThey are employed by Lord Brannon (Noble of the city of Inrast with a huge personal collection of dubiously aquired artefacts)\nThey are paid very well compared to the PCs\nProgress on digging through the hills is slow\nThe sent a messenger the day before to request a huge quantity of black powder\n\n[!gm] Grave robbing, but legally\nLet's be honest, the Society of Archeology has no moral high ground over Lord Barnnon, they are grave robbers in all but name. They do however have some legal ground (in Uruithel at least).\nThat's why they asked the PCs for an inventory of the tomb as detailed as possible. If the group comes back with the official papers all fill up, then the Society can claim the tomb as property of the museum and contest any item in Lord Barnnon' possession that would match one of the descripiton given by the PCs in their inventory of the place.\n\nSee <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/adventures/the-archeologists/the-archeologists-np-cs/#111ebd\">NPCs - Rival Group</a>\nCaerfaldir encampment\nA camp with a circular agencement made of various sized hexagonal and octogonal tents.\nThe tribe of <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/species/caerfaldir/\">Caerfaldir</a> (Leonins) goes hunting during dusk and just before dawn. The can be found resting during the hottest hours of the day. The will welcome travellers and share shade and water.\nThey are visibly uneasy, but welcome outsiders anyways. The PCs are invated to talk with the Chief of the tribe <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/adventures/the-archeologists/the-archeologists-np-cs/#0c7354\">Inaa</a>.\nThey are particulariy amicable which is unusual (DC 15 Insight check suggest that they might need something from the PCs)\nThey know about the tomb and they alos know of a secret passage to get to it. They are not particulary enchanted at the idea of strangers pillaging their ancestors place of rest, but they are also pragmatic and they are ready to tell the PCs where the entrance to the secret passage lies if the PCs retrieve for them a particular spear.\nThe tribe is quite deseparate for the spear. They will try their best to not show it (DC 15 Insight check, shows their desesparation). They are still prideful though and if ask about the ritual or why they are so desesparate they will simply answer &quot;Caerfal problems are for Caerfaldir to solve.&quot; and refuse to talk about the subject any further.\nSee <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/adventures/the-archeologists/the-archeologists-np-cs/#08d488\">Tribe's Members</a>\nWhat they know about :\nThe Oasis\n\nThere is an Oasis nearby\npublic Oasis, anyone can drink their fill and take as much as 2 waterskin of water per day to do as they please with it, but no more.\nThere is creature who claim the oasis as her own recently, she seems angry at something but has not beeen agressive towards the tribe. It seems wise not to anger her further, she seems powerful.\n\nCikryu\n\nThey react with fear to the name, but try to hide it.\nThe will answer with a bland &quot;Caerfal problems are for Caerfaldir to solve&quot; if pushed, they won't elaborate any further.\nA DC 20 Persuasion check (DC 25 if talking to the chief Inaa or the star-reader Ehor. Ugnela &quot;the one-who-counts&quot; cannot be convinced to talk in any circumstances), will convinced them to elaborate :\n\nIt seems to be a creature out of this world\nIt has beeen tormoenting the tribes for a while now, it has not kill anybody yet, because it &quot;enjoy seeing your fear grow and your tribe slowly fall apart.&quot;\nHunter were sent to kill it, none were successful\nThe star-readers and the &quot;one-who-counts&quot; (see. <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/adventures/the-archeologists/the-archeologists-np-cs/#08d488\">Trube's members</a>) think that there is a way to sent it back to were it truely belongs.\nInaa or Ehor knows a bit more :\n\nThey will whisper the word &quot;devil&quot;, but only once.\nThey tell that they think that particular spear was once belonging to an ancestor of the tribe and that it's their best shot at banishing the creature out of this world.\n\nThe Tomb\n\nThey know of a cave entrance further away which leads to the tomb.\nMost of the tribe are not very happy about strangers robbing the tombs of their ancestors, but they are also very pragmatic and they really need the help of the PCs to acquire the spear.\n\nThe Spear (<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/adventures/the-archeologists/the-archeologists-magic-items/#bf30ff\">Ahiir's Spear</a>)\n\nIt is magical, but otherwise looks exactely like any other soldier spear of the time. Made in wood with a bronze head and the name of the wielder inscribed in the handle.\nThe name inscribed into it is : Ahiir\nThe tribe need it for an important ritual.\n\nCikryu, the Rakshasa\nWhen the PCs leave the tribe a Rakshasa will accost them. Don't say he is a Rakshasa, but describe him in the same way you would describe the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/species/caerfaldir/\">Caerfaldir</a> (Leonin), but with tiger's features instead of lion's. He is smoking a pipe and relexed like if he was sitting in a noble's parlour in Inrast rather than in the middle of the desert.\nDC 10 Perception check let the PCs notice that he has inverted hands\nDC 20 History or Religion check let the PCs know that he is a Devil. (They will also know that Devils being Lawful Evil, generaly keep their words and only tell truth. It doesn't mean that they won't try to manipulate or deceive)\nThe Rakshasa will present himself as Cikryu and says that he overheard the PCs conversation with the tribe.\nHe offers an alternative. He also knows where the secret entrance is and propose to reveal it to the PCs if the latter bring him back a vial of pure water and a pouch of pure sand from the oasis nearby.\n(Spellcasters who succeed a DC 20 check on their spellcasting ability can intuit that those ingredient could be use for the summoning of an elemental).\nWhen asked why he doesn't do it himself, he answer that a &quot;particular someone&quot; has taken residence at the oasis and he would rather not talk to her at the moment. &quot;Things are... complicated&quot;, he clearly makes it sounds like a bad break-up while never explicitely telling so.\nHe will use such sentences as &quot;She can be intense&quot; or &quot;I wanted to distance myself for a while&quot;.\nDuring his dialog Cikryu will often use the terms &quot;contract&quot; or &quot;deal&quot; and will be adamant that he do not say lies (the word &quot;say&quot; is important there. He will still lie by omission or try to decieve) and upholds his promises.\nCharacter that notice that can retry a DC 15 History or Religion check to gather that he is a Devil.\nThe Museum (Tribe's route)\nIf the party decide to help the tribe and bring back the spear, they will have to travel back to Inrast.\nOnce back at the Museum, let them come with whatever idea or plan they want. Almost anything can work. Including :\n\nPersuading, Decieving or Intimidating the clerc in charge of the inventory.\n\nAdapt the DC depending on the credibility of the scenario.\nThey could pretend to be student needing a spear fo their research (DC 15 Persuasion/Deception)\nThey could simply Intimidate without other explanations (DC 15 Intimidation to get access to the spears, DC 20 Intimidation to ensure that the clerc will stay silent afterward)\n\nThey can bribe the clerc (the clerc will be more easily convinced by magical item or interesting unusual items rather than just money, if your PCs are really desesparate for ideas, money can work too.)\nThey can try to infiltrate the Museum at night (DC 15 Stealth)\n\nHowever they gained access to it, the PCs find themselves in a store room, where countless artefacts of lower value are kept. There is a rack with multiple similar looking spears.\nThe spear are in various state of decay but seem otherwise almost identical.\nEach is made from a wooden shaft with a bronze point. Each spear has a small inscription carved into it. The inscripiton is written in Ancient Laugsuil. PCs who have studied that languages can automatically know that the inscripiton are names.\nHow to find Ahiir's spear\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/adventures/the-archeologists/the-archeologists-magic-items/#bf30ff\">Ahiir's Spear</a> can be recognized by the PCs through different means :\n\nThe spear emit an aura of ancient magic (Detect Magic spell or a DC 15 Arcana check, DC 20 Religion check might also work)\nThe spear is the one who is the most well preserved of the bunch.\nThe spear has the inscription &quot;Aghiir&quot; written in Ancient Laugsuil. (A PCs who has studied Ancient Laugsuil can spot this right away, otherwise the clerc knows the basics of the language and can give them a transcription of the names on the spears.)\n\nOnce the the PCs bring back the spear to the tribe <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/adventures/the-archeologists/the-archeologists-np-cs/#aadf55\">Ehor</a> and <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/adventures/the-archeologists/the-archeologists-np-cs/#2b586c\">Ugnela</a> will verify its authenticity and in the case the PCs brought back the correct spear <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/adventures/the-archeologists/the-archeologists-np-cs/#49f95a\">Eniir</a> will be ordered to lead them to the secret passage.\nThe Oasis (Cikryu's route)\nIf the party decide to take Cikryu's offer, the will quickly find the oasis and a Lamia who has taken residence here.\nShe is still young for a Lamia and dream of making herself a lair with slaves at her service.\nWhen the PCs arrive, she is using the oasis as a scrying surface to locate Cikryu.\nRakshasa being immune to spell of 6th level or lower and the Scrying spell of the Lamia innate casting being considared a 5th level one, it is obviously not working.\nShe can be heard saying with anger &quot;Where is he ? Where is he ? How can he keep hidding from me ?&quot;\n\n[!gm] Cikryu and the Lamia\nThe Lamia is young and easily impressed by power, she has fallen for the charms of Cikryu and came to the oasis on his advice.\nShe is now angry at Cikryu because he as explicitely forbidden her to harm the Caerfal Tribe (only members of this specific tribe) and he is refusing to see her.\nHe is using her to further torment the Caerfal tribe, but doesn't want them to die or be enslave as he want to keep tormenting them and only kill them once he would have grown bored of them. (Which given he is a devil couls take quite some time...)\nIf the Lamia is killed the only comment from Cikryu will be &quot;Oh, what a shame! She had potential&quot;, but he doesn't seem sad nor angry.\n\nIf she sees the PCs, already angry and not at all in a mood to talk, she will exclaim : &quot;You will make decent slaves ! &quot; and attacks.\n\n[!gm] Adaptation for level 2\nThe Lamia has 70 HP and an AC of 12\nMultiattack : 1 attack with her dagger and 1 claw attack or she uses her intoxicating touch.\nDagger : to hit : +3, 1d4 + 2 piercing\nClaws : to hit : +3, 2d4 + 2 slashing\nIntoxicatin Touch : to hit : +3, Charisma save DC 12\non a fail : taget is cursed for 1 hour, disadvantage on Wisdom save and ability checks\nSpellcasting : Spellsave DC 13\n\nShe is also a coward and as soon as the combat cleary turns badly for her (either she lose more than 3/4 of her HP or she takes an absurd amount of damage in one turn), she will surrender begging for her life.\nShe might try to cast some sneaky Suggestion or Charm Person spell whie the PCs are talking to her.\nShe will talk a lot but not be overtly useful. The Pcs can gather the following informaion :\n\nShe is looking to establish a lair and wants to have slave of her own.\nCikryu is the one who encourage her to come to this oasis, but he forbid her to hurt or enslave the member of the Caerfal tribe nearby. She resent him for it. Feeling that it is a right to enslave them.\nShe will sometime refers to Cikryu as &quot;handsome devil !&quot;, hard to say if it is just a turn of phrase or if she knows that Cikryu is indeed a devil. (If your PCs already know that Cikryu is a devil or strongly suspect it, the Lamia can be ignorant about that fact. If your PCs have no idea that Cikryu is a Devil then the Lamia might know and be te one to reveal that fact to them.)\nShe knows nothing about the tomb and doesn't care about it.\n\nOnce the PCs brings back the water and the sand to Cikryu, he will lead them to the secret passage. The secret passage is a roughly a 100 meters (~330 feet) away from his own encampment.\nIf the PCs try to find the passage on their own, Cikryu is hidding it with a strong illusion. They have no chance to pierce through it.\nThe Cave\nAs to PCs navigate the narrow passages of the cave, they are attacked by 3 Kruthik.\n\n[!gm] Adaptation to level 2\nEach Kuhtrik as 20 HP and AC 16\nThey loose the multi-attack ability\nStap : to hit : +3, 1d6 + 1 piercing\nSpike : same range, to hit +3, 1d4 + 2 piercing\n\nOnce the Kruthik dispatched, they can access the tomb without further complication.\nThe Tomb\nTODO\n2 Mummies\n\n[!gm] Rhea and Ahor's tomb\n\nThe Ritual (Tribe's route)\nTODO\n\n[!gm] Cikryu and Ahiir\n~ 5'000 years ago, Cikryu managed to manipuling the then Emperor of Laugsuil rendering him mad and pushing the Empire into a terrible civil war.\nAhiir, the Emperor's own daughter joined the rebels and was armed as a simple soldier with a bronze spear.\nShe finally managed to kill Cikryu and send him back to the Nine Hells for thousand of years of torment while his body reforms\nThe Banishment speel requires an item distasteful to the target and no object is more hated by Cikryu than the spear that killed him.\n\nConsequences (Cikryu's route)\nTODO\nInvisible Stalker\nBack in Inrast\nThe PCs are paid the promised 100gp, if they completed a careful inventory of the tomb and did not steal anything from it (or were particulariy clever in the way they stole it and avoided waking up the Mummies and falsified the documents) they get an additional 100gp for a work well done.\nIf the PCs did a good enough job in the eyes of the Society, the latter will hire them again for the <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">The Giants Lost to Time</a> adventure. If they were showing some more ...loose morality, Lord Barnnon is the one to hire them instead.",

Delegations and expeditions from Côfûl, Rhuk, Uruithel, Baramlug, Rancanad, Thandnûr and even Calendôr and Eretol. The treacherous waters and aquatic monsters around the island often meant that this was a one way trip. Sadly each government was convinced that the disappearances of their ships was due to the sabotage of their rivals and thus, they kept sending more and better equipped ships to the new island. Tales of gigantic monsters and cursed waters started to spread among the sailors and soon t became harder and harder to find volunteers agreeing to set sail for the island who was now known as &quot;Húnatol&quot; the Cursed Island. The high cost of those expeditions combined with the lack of positive results finally convinced the various governments to stop sending new ships to the island and on a tacit common accord the whole affair was quietly forgotten. This happened 15 years ago. You were part of one of those hapless expeditions that find themselves stranded on Húnatol. Since then, survivor from every origin have set aside their differences and banded together to make a life for themselves on the island or find a way to leave it.\nPlayers Info\nCharacter Creation\nEach character gets 1 language from their Origin, plus 1 additional free language : <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/languages/lam-lammain/\">I Lam</a>\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/places/hunatol/#62609b\">Background Information</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/places/hunatol/#5285d7\">Inhabitants</a>\n\nGM Info\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">The Cursed Island - NPCs</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">The Cursed Island - Locations</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">The Cursed Island - Factions</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">The Cursed Island - Quests</a>",

It can be played that way, but that is not the intent behind the creation of this system.\nThe idea of this system and the stories it will allow to tell is : how does a character keep going when they have reached their lowest point. The focus of this system is not the fight where you took an arrow to the knee, but all of the fights that happen after that. How do you keep fighting with a destroyed knee ?\nOne core mechanic of this system is the Injuries, some are temporary and can be heal, some are permanent, but a permanent Injury is not an end to the character ; it is a challenge to the player : How do they manage this Injury and learn to live with it ?\nThis is a story of getting up again, no matter how much time it takes, no matter if we get up on our own legs or find sturdy sticks to keep walking or if we have a friend to carry us the rest of the way.\nSimple, but brutal\nWith those principle in mind, remember that the combats in this system are designed to be simple but brutal. Fighting outnumbered is probably a bad idea and will almost always get you killed. Dying is the end of the road for your character ; there exist no resurection magic in this world.\nFuel for RP\nThe Needs, Injuries and Recovery Activities are the foundations for a character's roleplay. They can change over time and evolve with the character. Players are encouraged to adapt their Recovery Activities in reaction to the new Injuries of their character. A Recovery Activity is not necessary be a healthy habit, it might even be a destructive way to cope.\nThe second pillar of roleplay is the group dynamic. How will the character help each other ? Will they even help ? Will they try to help but do more harm than good in the process ?\nOne-shots or short stories\nFor one-shots or short stories where full character's arcs might not have the time to be properly explore, the GM might one to focus more one NPCs, their problems and how the group might help them (or not).",

		"content": "Basics\nRrules for the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/neldar-system/\">Neldar System</a>.\nFundamental Values (Mind, Body, Spirit)\nEvery character and creature in the game has three Fundamental values representing their Being: Mind, Body and Spirit.\nResources (Focus, Endurance, Resilience)\nFor each Fundamental value a resource is associated. You can see it as having three separated health bars.\nFocus which is the resource of the Mind, endurance the resource of the Body and resilience the resource of the Spirit. The maximum of each resource cannot be higher than three times its corresponding Fundamental Value.\nEach Resource has some Recovery Dice associated with it. Those dice will be used while <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/rest-resourcing-activities-and-downtime/\">Resting</a>. (see. <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/character-creation/character-creation-points-distribution/\">Character Creation - Points Distribution</a> for how to set the recovery dice)\nResources are used in Combat (see. <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/combat-and-injuries/\">Combat and Injuries</a>) or when making Skill CHecks (see. below)\nAttributes\n\nType\nMind\nBody\nSpirit\n\nActive / Raw Strength\nMemory / Knowledge\nPhysic\nCharisma\n\nReactive / Finesse\nWits\nReaction Speed\nManipulation / Insight\n\nDefensive\nComposure\nPain Tolerance\nVolition\n\nThe value of an attribute is a type of die (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12). An increase in the die category (from d6 -&gt; d8) can be bought with points at character creation or after a level up (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/character-creation/character-creation-points-distribution/\">Character Creation - Points Distribution</a>)\nSkills\nThere are 18 skills separated in three catagories linked to Mind, Body and Spirit.\n\nMind\nBody\nSpirit\n\nArcane Magic\nAthletics\nAnimal Affinity\n\nRhetoric / Linguistic\nCraft\nDeception\n\nCulture / History\nFighting\nIntimidation\n\nInvestigation\nPerformance\nPersuasion\n\nResearch / Sciences\nStealth\nInsight/Empathy\n\nMysticism / Occultism\nThievery\nRaw Magic\n\nThree of the skills are Defense skills, Aracane Magic, Fighting and Raw Magic are taken into account when defending against attacks or damage affecting the corresponding part of the being.\nEach skill has a rank - ranks can be bought with points at character creation or after a level up (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/character-creation/character-creation-points-distribution/\">Character Creation - Points Distribution</a>).\nA rank in a skill cannot be higher than the score in the Fundamental value (Mind, Body or Spirit).\n\nIf Ayrina has a Mind score of 4 and Spirit score of 2, she can buy up to 4 ranks in Arcane Magic, but only 2 ranks in Persuasion.\n\nSkill Checks\nA skill check is done by combining a skill with an attribute. The rank of the skill determine the number of dice that can be bought and the attribute determine the type of the dice.\nThe first die is always free, each additional die costs 1 point of resource (either focus, endurance or resilience depending on the skill used)\nAdditionally, if the skill check is linked to a speciality of the character, then the character gains 1 additional free die for the check.\n\nExample :\nArinya wants to translate a stone tablet written in Ancient Laugsuil.\nThe GM asks for a roll of Linguistic on Memory / Knowledge.\nShe has a rank 2 in Rhetoric / Linguistic and d6 in Memory / Knowledge.\nShe has a specialisation in Ancient Laugsuil.\nShe gets 2d6 for free thanks to 1 free die and her specialisation. However, the GM told her that the check would be quite hard. She decides to spend 2 focus points to get 2 additional dice.\nShe can now roll 4d6 at the cost of 2 focus\n\nSpecialities\nA character can choose a free specialisation when they reach rank 3 in a particular skill.\nAdditionally, some skills let you choose a speciality at ranks 1. Those are Rhetoric/Linguistic, Culture/History, Research/Science, Athletics, Fighting and Performance.\nPushing past your limits\nIf a character has a rank high enough in a skill to buy more dice, but not enough resources to do so, they can choose to buy dice of a category less (d6 -&gt; d4) for twice as much of one other resource.\n\nFrom our example before, let's say that Arinya has only 1 point of focus left. She would not be able to buy the 2 additional dice.\nShe could buy 1 additional d6 for 1 focus, then decide to spend 2 points of resilience to buy an additional d4.\nShe now would be able to roll 3d6 + 1d4 for 1 focus and 2 resilience.\n\nHelping on a skill check\nSome skill checks can benefit from the help of one or more other characters.\nTo help on a skill checks, every character that want to help must make a check with the same skill and attribute as the main check, but with a set Difficulty of 10.\nFor every success, the person making the main check will be able to re-roll a die in their pool.\nIf the roll for helping was a critical success, a die can be re-roll until it is no longer a 1.\nFatigue, Exhaustion and Stress\nIt is still possible to do a task with no resources left, but this will instead increment the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level and prompt a roll on the corresponding Injury table. (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/old-v1-rules/combat-and-injuries-v1/#5a0385\">Injuries</a>).\nIt is also the case if a creature takes damage on a resource (focus, endurance or resilience) which is already at 0.\nIf the cost of the task or the damage received is greater than 9 then the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level increments by 2, similarly if the cost or damage is greater than 19 then the level increment by 3, and so on and so forth.\nThe Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level is subtracted from any roll made with the corresponding resources.\n\nExample\nArinya has a Stress level of 2. She wants to make a Deception check, lying to her friends pretending that everything is ok.\nShe assembles her pool of dice and get to roll 2d6, but she will have to subtract her Stress level from the total.\nShe rolls 2d6 - 2 ;  she gets a 3 and a 4 on the dice for a total of  3 + 4 - 2 = 5 !\n\nCritical Success and Failure\nA critical success occurs when the total of the dice is double or more than the set difficulty.\nA critical failure on the other hand happens when the total roll is less than half of the set difficulty.\nPerception Checks\nPerception checks are always free. They use dice pools determined by the species of the character. (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/character-creation/character-creation-species/#443e3a\"> Character Creation - Species - Senses</a>)\nDifficulty of Skill Checks\n\n[!gm] GM : Setting a difficulty\nTo set the difficulty of a skill, you can use this table :\n\nDifficulty\nscore\nnotes\n\nTrivial\n2+\nGaranteed succeess when either having a specialty or buying 1 die.\n\nVery Easy\n4+\n\nEasy\n6+\n\nMedium\n8+\nRoughly 50% chance of succees with 2d6 or 2d8 (at least 1 die should be bought, signifying that a bit of effort must be put into the task. Alternatively, can sometimes be done effortlessly - without buying dice - if the character has a specialty)\n\nHard\n12+\nRequired to have at least 1 rank in the skill to succeed (or be very lucky with a d12 attribute)\n\nVery Hard\n16+\n\nImpossible\n20+",

Each one may not be less than 1 or greater than 10.\nEvery time you gain a level, you will gain 2 additional points. (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/progression/character-progression/\">Character Progression</a>)\nEvery even level, your maximum for your Fundamental values increases by 1.

Some Subspecies gives a second Resistance or impart a Vulnerability. Immunities are extremely rare.\nTo learn how they are used in game see (<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/combat-and-injuries/#abbeee\">Combat - Resistances, Vulnerabilities and Immunities</a>).\nNeeds\n(see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/basics/\"> Neldar System - Basics</a>)\nThere are three basics needs : sunlight exposure linked to the Mind, eating linked to the Body and dreaming/sleeping linked to the Spirit. Each one must be fulfilled in order to benefit the most from a rest. Fulfilling of needs is counted over a 24 hours period.\nA need that is not fulfilled will impact a penalty on your recovery die of that type.\nWarning : A species with a needs of zero for one category will count as having their need not fulfilled if any other of their needs has not been fulfilled either.",

You can choose 1 native language and 1 additional language per rank in your Rhetoric / Linguistic skill.\nBackstory\nTo write your backstory you can get some inspiration by answering some of the following questions :\n\nHow do you feel about your native culture/religion ? Do you agree with the values it has taught you or do you reject its teaching ? Are those questions something you never thought to ask yourself ?\n\nLook at your Fundamentals, your Abilities and your Competences, is there one where you are really good or really bad at ? Why would it be so ? (In your youth, you spent the majority of your time studying and you hated exercising, this would explain a poor score in Body, but some better stat in Memory and Education )\n\nWho were the important people in your life ? Give them names. The person or people that raised you, the people you were close to but which whom you eventually fall apart, the people you are still close to, the people you hate or who hate you.\n\nDo you have dreams or long term goals ?

The cost can be other resources, time or simple money. Each resourcing activity is personal to each character, their cost and benefice may vary from character to character.\nOne character might be greatly helped focusing by drinking coffee, but not really tolerate the acidity of the beverage thus gaining a 1d4 focus and a -2 endurance when drinking a cup.\nAn other one might tolerate the acidity well but becoming a little bit agitated gaining a +1d4 to focus and a -2 to resilience.\nA nice walk in nature might gives you a +1d4 to resilience and a +1d4 to focus while costing you only 2 endurance, but to complete this activity you need at least 1 hour and access to nature or a park.\nOptional Rules : Addictions\nSome Activities might have a potential for Addiction (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/optional-rules/\">Optional Rules</a>)\nIf your character develop an addiction to the Activity then it will stop being a Resourcing Activity and instead become a new Need.",

		"content": "Combat and Injuries\nCombat rules for <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/neldar-system/\">Neldar System</a>.\nCombat\nCombat start when a PC or an NPC does any action that the other party considers to be hostile. There are no surprised round, instead at any point during combat, a target can be unaware of its attacker. Every time a defendant is unaware of an attack, the difficulty of the check to Dodge / Deflect or Resist it is doubled.\nA target may be unaware of an attacker if it doesn't physically perceive it or if it doesn't think the attacker as potentially hostile.\nInitiative\nInitiative is always rolled at the moment an aggressive action is declared and before it is taken. Unaware targets might not take actions and simply skip their turn if they roll a better initiative than the instigator of the attack.\nInitiative is usually rolled with the Reaction Speed die. However, in specific situations an other attribute die can be used. For example, a duel between wizards might call for an initative roll with the Wits die.\nThe number of dice used is equal to the Fighting skill rank (minimum of 1). Once again, specific situations might use an other skills (with always a minumum of 1 die). A rogue trying to stay hidden might be able to use their Stealth skill instead.\n\nInitiative = Fighting d Reaction Speed\n\nSometimes it is also possible to roll Initiative with one of the Senses/Perception Pool. In the case of an ambush, the ambusehd partx might used one of their Senses as their Initiative Pool.\nCombat Turn\nCombatants take their turn in order of initiative. On their turn a combatant can take 2 Actions.\nAn Action is :\n\nMove (up to one's speed)\n\nStep (Move 2m without provoking <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/progression/skill-feat/#150996\">Attacks of Opportunity</a>)\nCharge (Use 2 Actions to move in a straight line up to twice your speed and make a mele attack. )\nDisengage (use both of your Actions to move up to your speed, but without provoking <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/progression/skill-feat/#150996\">Attacks of Opportunity</a>)\n\nAttack (make a melee or ranged attack)\n\nGrapple (No damage, but reduces any speed to 0. - needs a free hand)\nShove (No damage but push the target 2m away - needs a free hand or shield)\nThrow (A character can throw a light weapon up to 2 times their physics die in meters)\nTake Aim (Next ranged attack action will gain a free die of 1 category less)\nReload (Some weapons, like crossbows, need to be reloaded with 1 Action)\n\nAttack with an Instrument\n\nInsult (Sort of unarmed Instrument Attack, see below)\n\nHealing with an Instrument\n\nCast a spell (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/spells/\">Spells</a>)\n\nRemove 1 rune from a spell and add 1 rune to a spell.\n\nUse a special ability (mainly for creatures)\n\nReady an Action (Readying an Action allows to act out of turn, when a trigger occurs but takes 2 Actions)\n\nOut of their turn a combattant can :\n\nAttack of Opportunity (need the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/progression/skill-feat/#150996\">Attack of Opportunity Feat</a> to unlock, or a weapon with a special trait)\nDefend\n\nDodge an attack, spell. or ability (avoid all damage)\nResist an attack, spell or ability. (Half damage, avoid Condition)\n\nAttack\nAn attack roll with a weapon works like a skill check on Fighting with Physics. It is not possible to make an attack with Reaction Speed or Pain Tolerance, except if a particular weapon allows it.\nThe total result of the attack roll will be used to set the difficulty for the defendant wether they want to Dodge or Resist the damage.\nOnce an attack is successful, the damage roll is defined by the weapon the attacker is wielding.\nUnarmed Attack : An unarmed physical attack is done like any attack, except its always deals 1 Bludgeoning Damage, unless the character possess a Feat that specify otherwise.\nFlanking (melee) : When a line from the middle of two allied tokens pass through an enemy token, the enemy is flanked by the two allies.\nWhen an enemy is flanked, the allies flanking them get a free die of 1 category less than their main die on their melee attacks.\nInstrument Attack or Healing\nAn attack roll or healing with an Instrument is done using Perfomance on Charisma and resilience is used to buy the dice.\nWhen helaing the Difficulty is a set 12 that can be modified by the type or quality of the instrument.\nInsult : An insult can be seen as a sort of unarmed Instrument Attack. It is roll with Performance on Charisma and deals a fixed 1 Anxiety Damage on the Spirit. (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/combat-and-injuries/#173746\">Damage Types</a>). As with all Instrument Attacks, an Insult cannot be dodge only resisted. For this special case, if the target successfully Resists the insult all damage is negated.\nDodging\nDodging an attack, spell or ability by using dice from the appropriate Defense Pool (see below) will allow the combatant to completely negates all effects of the spell or the attack.\nDodge checks are always made on Wits, Reaction Speed or Insight / Manipulation and it is not possible to buy dice with an other resource.\nDodging a Body attack is always rolled with Fighting on Reaction Speed and only endurence can be use to buy dice from the Body Defense Pool.\nResisting\nResisting a spell or an attack by using dice from the appropriate Defense Pool (see below) will allow the combattant to halve any incoming damage and avoid additional effects or conditions.\nIn usual circomstances the defendant can choose to Dodge/Deflect or Resist the effects of an incoming attack unless the attack precises otherwise. A spellcaster can choose if their spell can be Deflected only, Resisted only or let the target choose. (see. <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/spells/#bdc950\">Spells</a>)\nResisting a Spirit attack is always rolled with Raw Magic on Volition and only resilience can by use to buy dice from the Spirit Defense Pool.\nCritical Success on Attacks\nWhen a character dodge / deflect or resisit an attack, if the total they rolled is strictly less than half of the Difficulty (the attacker's or caster's total roll), then it is considered to be a critical success for the attacker and all incoming damage are doubled. Double the damage before applying any Resistance or Vulnerability.\nDefense Pools\nEach character has three different Defense Pools, one for their Mind based on their Arcane Magic skill, one for Body based on their Fighting skill and one for their Spirit based on their Raw Magic skill.\nThe maximum of a Defense Pool is equal to the skill rank + 1. At the start of their turn a character's Defense Pools are reset to their respective maximums.\nWhenever a character is attacked during a round, they can choose to buy dice from their appropriate Defense Pool to try to Dodge / Deflect or Resist the attack (or spell). Dice bought this way are removed from the Pool until the start of the character next turn.\nThe first die is always free as well as any die granted by an eventual armour. The free dice are never removed from the Dice Pool.\nThe armour value for the Mind is called Ward and the armour value for the Spirit is called Veil.\nDual Wielding\nWhen a character is dual wielding weapons this enables them to make two attacks per Action, one with each weapons. However, the two attacks share the same dice pool based on the Fighting skill. Each attacks benefits from the free die and any speciality die any other die must be bought from the attack pool.\nThe attack pool is reset after each Action taken.\nDamage Type\nEach damage type affects one part of the Being except for poison who can affect all three.\n\nMind (reduces focus !<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">15</a>)\nBody (reduces endurance !<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">15</a>)\nSpirit (reduces resilience !<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">15</a>)\n\nConfusion\nPiercing / Slashing\nFear\n\nOblivion\nBludgeoning / Force\nCharm\n\nPsychic\nFire / Heat / Lightning\nDespair\n\nCold / Freezing\nAnxiety\n\nAcid\n\nPoison\nPoison\nPoison\n\nResitances, Vulnerabilities and Immunities\nResistances, Vulnerabilities and Immunities are always linked to a damage type and usually granted by one's species or special feats.\nResistances and Vulnerabilites comes with a value, generally a dynamic one like &quot;Half your Body score&quot; or &quot;Equal to your level&quot;. When applying resistances and vulnerability the value is removed from the total damage (in the casse of resistances) or added to it (in the case of vulnerabilities) before the damage is applied to the character.\nImmunities reduce any damage of that type to 0.\n\nAyrina is a <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/species/sub-species/peat-goblins-orcs/\">Peat Orc</a> an <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/species/orcs/\">Orc</a> Subspecies. . She gets a Bludgeoning Resistance equal to Half of her Body score thanks to her Species, but suffers from a Vulnerability to Fire equal to Half of her level rounded down (min 1).\nShe has a Body score of 8 and a level of 4.\nShe is attacks by someone using a Flamming Mace and failed her Dodge.\nHer opponent rolls the damage and get a result of 5 Bludgeoning + 2 Fire.\nHer Resistance to Bludgeoning has a value of (8/2 = 4), so she will only take 5 - 4 = 1 Bludgeoning damage.\nOn the other hand, her Vulnerability to Fire has a value of (4/2 = 2) so she will take 2 + 2 = 4 Fire damage.\n\nInjuries\n\nEvery times someone does a task without the necessary resources to pay the cost of said task their Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level increases by 1, depending on the part of their Being the skill is associated with.\nIt is also the case if a creature takes damage on a resource (focus, endurance or resilience) which is already at 0.\nWork In Progress : unsure When a resource is at 0, only 1 additional die can be bought by incrementing the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress counter by 1.\nFree dice never increase those counters.\nIf the damage received are greater than 9 then the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level increments by 2, similarly if the cost or damage is greater than 19 then the level increment by 3, and so on and so forth.\nEvery time the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level of a creature increments it must roll on the corresponding Injury table.\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/injuries-and-curses/\">Injuries and Curses</a>\nInjuries Rolltables\nA roll for an Injury is done in two steps. The first step will define if the Injury will be Temporary or Permanent. It is done by roll 1d6 and adding the corresponding Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level.\nA result of 7 or lower gives a Temporary Injury, any result strictly higher than 7 means that the Injury will be Permanent.\n\nAyrina has a Fatigue level of 2 and 0 point of focus left. She takes 14 Oblivion damage on her Mind incrementing her Fatigue level by an additional 2 (14 is greater than 9 so the level increases by 2).\nShe now has to roll 1d6 + 4, she rolled a 5 for a total of 5 + 4 = 9.\n9 being strictly greater than 7, she will suffer from a Permanent Mind Injury !\n\nTemporary Injuries\nTemporary injuries either heal with time or are easily healed with a commonly available treatment. They impart some handicaps on the creature until they are healed.\nPermanent Injuries\nPermanent injuries are either very hard to heal or cannot be healed at all. Their handicaps are permanent and the creature must learn to live with them the best they can.\nAdvices for Game Masters - Storytellers : If a character suffer from an Injury due to damage, you can tell them to roll on the rolltable, but you are not forced to use the result as the Injury as is. Don't hesitate to modify or create new Injuries linked to the type or damage or situation the characters find themselves in.\nA paralytic poison will probably have different lasting effects than a burn or a broken bone.\n\n[!gm] Note on Creatures\nTo simplify combat, creature controlled by the game masters don't get injuries. They will instead die as soon as either their focus, endurance or resilience reach 0.\nWhen a creature drops to 0 in a resource due to something else than damage (while attacking or defending) the creature doesn't die immediately, but enters a weaken state where they can not use abilities that cost them more than 1 of this resource.\n\nDeath\nAt any moment, if the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level of a character goes above 6 the character dies.\nThere is one exception for <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/species/sub-species/willow-elves/\">Willow Elves</a> who get the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/progression/species-feat/#df31ab\">Spirit Tree Feat</a>.\n\n[!wip] Other Exceptions (Work In Progress)\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/species/sub-species/sand-goblins-orcs/\">Sand Orc</a> who gets the <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Sturdy Body Feat</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/species/sub-species/lapis-lazuli-gnomes/\">Lapis-lazuli Gnomes</a> who gets the <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Stubborn Mind Feat</a>\n\nDeath is permanent, resurrection magic doesn't exist in this world.",

A character can have up to 3 inspiration tokens at the same time.\n\n1 inspiration token can be use to re-roll the latest dice pool rolled by the character.\n2 inspiration tokens can be used to make an NPCs or any creature controlled by the GM re-rolled their latest dice pool.\n\nImportant : Inspiration tokens cannot be traded between players ! If a player feel like an other should be rewarded for their RP, they can ask the GM to give that player a token but they cannot give a token of their own.\nLevel up\nWhen the group as a whole accomplishes something significant, overcomes an obstacle or otherwise undergoes some kind of growth, the GM can reward each member of the group with a new level.\nEach level, a character gains a number of points decided by the GM to spend in their Fundamentals (2 by default).\nThey also gain points (10 by default) to spend on their attributes and skills.\nAt each new level they also gain a new Feat, (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/progression/character-progression/\">Character Progression</a>).\nLearning new skills\nWhile leveling up a player can only spend points in skills that their character already knows. Spending points in a new skill requires the character to have found a way to learn it. Finding books about a subject, a teacher or starting to spend time training with an other player character are all valid ways to learn a new skill.",

The more complexe and powerful the Magical Item is, the more powerful and precised the magic used to create it was and the more unstable it can become when used by someone elfe than the intended person..\nIn order to obtain a magical item the player must go through 4 phases.\n\nDefinition\nInformation Gathering\nIngredients Gathering\nCrafting\n\nDefinition\nThe first phase is done by the player themself as opposed as the character. The player and the GM define together what would be the magical item and its effect(s). The phase can also be done by the GM exclusively.\nThat's also the phase when the GM can veto any idea that would not fit the narrative or the universe.\nInformation Gathering\nThe second phase is were the characters start to get involved. The player describe what steps their character take to gather information or what experiment they conduct to better learn how to make the item.\nThe GM then ask for the relevant checks. Depending on the success of those checks, the GM will give a recipe for the magic item. If a character fails all of their research checks while trying to learn how to make a flame sword the GM might give them the recipe for a frost sword instead. (The GM is encouraged to always give something to the character, but more fails lead to a recipe further away from what the character initially wanted to achieve.)\nIngredients Gathering\nThis phase is pretty self explanatory, the characters set off on a mission to gather all of the required ingredients.\nThe more potent the planned item, the rarer the ingredient and more difficult to gather.\nCrafting\nOnce all the necessary information and ingredients gathered the character(s) can start the crafting process. The GM will ask for the relevant checks. The better the result the stronger the item. If some of those checks fail, the item will still have the basic potency describe by the information given during the Information Gathering phase, but might have some negative effects added to it.\nA poorly crafted flame sword might have the added risk of burning its wielder adding a 25% chance of taking 1d4 Fire damage after every hit.",

The maximum of each resource cannot be higher than two times its corresponding Fundamental Value.\nCompetence Check\nLinked to Mind, Body or Spirit are multiple Competences. Each one has a name, a score and a Cost. Every time a creature try to do something that has the potential of failing, a Competence check is made.\nFirst add the score value of the Competence to the Ability that will be used. Each Competence has a default Ability, but in some cases an other Ability might be more appropriate. If a creature wants to throw its dagger with as much force as possible the ability used will be Physic, if on the other hand, the creature wants to carefully aim for a specific target then the Ability used would be Coordination. (A case could be made for the use of Senses if the success of this check depend on the creature successful perceiving the location of its target.)\nThe Fundamental value is added along with any circumstantial bonuses or maluses in order to obtain the final score.\nThe creature then roll 1d100, the check is a success if the result of the roll is less or equal to the final score of the Competence.\n\nExemple :\nArinya wants to translate a stone tablet written in Ancient Laugsuil.\nThe GM tells Arinya's player that the check will be on Education, because the only time Arinya was exposed to Ancient Laugsuil was during her school days.\nHer competence in Ancient Laugsuil is 5, her Education is 8 and her Mind is 6 this gives her a final score of 5+8+6 = 19.\nArinya's player roll 1d100 and gets a 89. It's a failure.\nArinya spend 1 hour and 1 focus trying to translate the tablet but does not achieve her goal.\n\nCost, #Fatigue, #Exhaustion and #Stress\nEach Competence has a cost in its corresponding resource (focus, endurance or resilience). For each action that is not instantaneous, like shooting a bow or trying to dodge or parry an attack, their cost is counting for up to 1 hour, if the activity last longer than 1 hour, the cost must be paid again.\nA task cost must be paid whether or not the it is successful.\nIt is still possible to do a task with no resources left, but this will instead increment the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level and prompt a roll on the corresponding Injury table. (see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/old-v1-rules/combat-and-injuries-v1/#5a0385\">Injuries</a>)\nEasy success and Effortless success\nWhen you roll below half of your score you get an easy success and the cost of the task your were doing is divided by 2. If you roll below a fifth of your score, you get an effortless success and the cost of the task is reduced to 1.",

There are no surprised round, instead if the target is unaware of its attacker, the attack gain a +30 unaware bonus. If the target tries to parry or dodge, it will also suffer a malus of -30.\nA target may be unaware of an attacker if it doesn't physically perceive it or if it doesn't think the attacker as potentially hostile.\nInitiative\nBefore the #initiative is rolled, the #readiness of each creature is calculated. On the VTT the formula is the following.\nReadiness\n\nReadiness = ((your current focus / your max focus ) + ( your current endurance/ your max endurance) + (your current resilience /your max resilience) ) / 3 )* 100 rounded down.\n\nHowever it is a daunting calculation to do by hand every time a combat start.\nAn alternate formula for readiness is to simply add your current focus, endurance and resilience together.\nReadiness Alternate\n\nReadiness = current focus + current endurance + current resilience\n\nTo get your initiative score, roll a 1d100 and substract to result from your readiness. Also substract your fatigue, exhaustion and stress levels.\nInitiative score\n\nReadiness - [1d100] - fatigue level - exhaustion level - stress level\n\nCombat Turn\nCombatants take their turn in order of initiative. On their turn a combatant can :\n\n#Attack\nCast a spell (see <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Spells (v1)</a>)\nUse a special ability\n\nWhen a defendant is attacked they can choose to #Parry or #Dodge once before their next turn.\nAttack\nAn attack is almost like a normal check using the competence appropriate for the weapons the combatant is currently wielding. Additionally, the armour value of the target is substracted from the competence value.\nDodge\nSimilarly, dodging uses the Dodge competence to which the doge malus of any equipped shield or armour is substracted.\nParry\nParrying simply uses the competence associated with the weapons the combatant is currently wielding.\nDual Wielding\n#dual_wielding\nYou can have one weapon in each hand, doing so allows you to attack with both your weapons during you turn however you suffer a penalty of -30 on both attacks and can not use the specials capacities of your weapons linked to the One Handed Weapon Competence. You can however use the specials capacities of your weapons linked to the Dual Wielding Competence.\nDamage Type\n#damage_type\nEach damage type affects one part of the Being except for poison who can affect all three.\n\nMind (reduces focus)\nBody (reduces endurance)\nSpirit (reduces resilience)\n\nConfusion\nPiercing / Slashing\nFear\n\nOblivion\nBludgeoning / Force\nCharm\n\nPsychic\nFire / Heat / Lightning\nDespair\n\nCold / Freezing\nAnxiety\n\nAcid\n\nPoison\nPoison\nPoison\n\nInjuries\n#Injuries, #injury, #Fatigue, #Exhaustion , #Stress\nEvery times someone does a task without the necessary resources to pay the cost of said task their Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level increments by 1, depending on the part of their Being the competence is associated with.\nIt is also the case if a creature takes damage on a resource (focus, endurance or resilience) which is already at 0.\nIf the cost of the task or the damage received are greater than 9 then the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level increments by 2, similarly if the cost or damage is greater than 19 then the level increment by 3, and so on and so forth.\nEvery time the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level of a creature increments it must roll on the corresponding Injury table.\nTemporary Injuries\nTemporary injuries either heal with time or are easily healed with a commonly available treatment. They impart some maluses on the creature until they are healed.\nPermanent Injuries\nPermanent injuries are either very hard to heal or cannot be healed at all. There maluses are permanent and the creature must learn to live with them the best they can.\nNote on Creatures\nTo simplify combat, creature don't get injuries. They will instead die as soon as etheir their focus, endurance or resilience reach 0. To compensate for this fact, creature have 3 time their Fubdamental score in resource maximum. (ie. a creature with a Body score of 6 will have 18 endurance max instead of the 12 that a character would get.)\nDeath\nAt any moment, if the Fatigue, Exhaustion or Stress level of a character goes above 6 the character dies.\nDeath is permanent, resurrection magic doesn't exist in this world.",

If a player feel like an other should be rewarded for their RP, they can ask the GM to give that player a token but they cannot give a token of their own.\nSpecial case : when a d100 is rolled, an inspiration token can be used to re-roll the full d100, only the digit die or only the tens die.\n\nExample :\nArinya is trying to hit a monster with her rapier. Her total score for One Handed Weapons adds up to 27.\nArinya's player roll 1d100 and gets a 28. It would be a failure, but Arinya has one inspiration token that was previously given by the Game Master. To maximize their odd of sucesse, Arinya's player decide to use their inspiration token to re-roll only the digit die. They roll 1d10 and this time gets a 4. The final result is a 24 which is under 27 and therefore a success !\n\nLevel up\nWhen the group as a whole accomplishes something significant, overcomes an obstacle or otherwise undergoes some kind of growth, the GM can reward each member of the group with a new level.\nEach level, a character gains a number of points decided by the GM to spend in their Fundamentals (2 by default).\nThey also gain points (3 by default) to spend in their abilities and some (20 by default) to spend in their competences.\nLearning new competences\nWhile leveling up a player can only spend points in competences that their character already knows.

A Persuasion task would usually cost 2 resilience, but that would increase her stress level. She however still has almost all of her focus left today.\nSo she decide to try the Persuasion task while pushing through, paying 4 focus instead of the 2 resilience.\n\nAddictions\nSome Resourcing Activities might have a risk of #Addiction. The Addiction risk must be defined at the creation of the Activity by the player and the GM.\nIf a character indulge in such an activity at a frequency equal or above the risk frequency of the activity, they must roll an addiction check.\nThe player roll 1d100 and if the result is higher than the addiction threshold of the activity - the number of days they have been partaking in the activity, they fail the check and become addicted.\n\nsuccess if 1d100 &lt; =addiction threshold - number of day\n\nWhen a character is addicted to an activity, this activity stops being a Resourcing Activity for them (they gain no benefice, but still have to pay the cost) and it becomes an additional Needs. (The player and the GM determines together which part of the Being the activity affects if unmet.)\nAs long as the addiction counts as a Need for a character, that character is considered Addicted and all the Addicted supplementary effects of the activity applies to them.\nCuring an Addiction\nMainly, an addiction is cured by refraining from indulging it for a sufficient amount of time. When a Needs originating from an addiction is not met two days in a row the character is considered in Withdrawal, if the character then manage to not partake in the activity for a period of time equal or greater than the withdrawal period they are considered in remission and the addiction is removed from their Needs.\nDuring the withdrawal period the character must make relapse checks under certain circumstances and with more a less of a malus depending on the specific circumstance. The player rolls 1d100 if the result is higher than the addiction potential minus the number of days they have been in withdrawal then they fail the check and must seek out the fastest way to partake in the addictive activity again.\n\n1d100 &lt;= addiction threshold + number of day in withdrawal\n\nThe circumstances and their modifiers on a relapse check are as follow :\n\nDescription\nPenalty\n\nPeriodical check\nSome activities ask for a periodical relapse check during withdrawal.\n0\n\nIdea check\nWhen something in the environment of the character reminds them of the activity\n-10\n\nTemptation check\nWhen the opportunity to partake in the activity is directly presented to the character.\n-30\n\nOf course the GM and players are encouraged to find creative alternative ways to cure a character's addiction. They might want to try to get rid of their drinking habit by instead going for a walk with a friend or finding a new hobby. As a GM consider giving bonus on the relapse checks when players come up with alternatives way to manage or heal their character's addiction.\nAdditional Effect of Damage\nEvery time a creature take damage of a certain type, there is a chance that it will suffer an additional effect. To resist the additional effect, the player must roll a 1d100 and get a result lower or equal to 80 + their resistance - their vulnerability to that damage type.\n\n[1d100] &lt;= 80 + damage resistance - damage vulnerability\n\nMind (reduces focus)\nBody (reduces endurance)\nSpirit (reduces resilience)\n\nConfusion (Light / Radiant)Bewildered\nPiercing / SlashingBleeding\nFearAfraid\n\nOblivion (Dark / Necrotic)Oblivious\nBludgeoning / ForceBroken bones\nCharmCharmed\n\nPsychicIrrational\nFire / Heat / LightningBurning\nDespairDepressed\n\nCold / IceFreezing\nAnxietyPanicked\n\nAcidCorroding\n\nPoisonPoisoned\nPoisonPoisoned\nPoisonPoisoned\n\n#Conditions\n\nEffect\n**Description **At the start of their turn the target\nEnds\n\n#Bewildered\nNeeds to spend 2 focus points or they are too confused to be able to take a decision and don't act on their turn.\nRegains at least 1 focus point.\n\n#Bleeding\nLooses 1 endurance at the start of their turn.

		"content": "Optional Rules\nOptional Rules ofr <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/neldar-system/\">Neldar System</a>.\nAddictions\nSome Resourcing Activities might have a risk of Addiction. The Addiction risk must be defined at the creation of the Activity by the player and the GM.\nIf a character indulge in such an activity at a frequency equal or above the risk frequency of the activity, they must roll an addiction check.\nThe addiction check is always made on Volition. The maximum number of die is a fixed 3. As always the first die is free, the other two can potentially be bought with resilience .\nWhen a character is addicted to an activity, this activity stops being a Resourcing Activity for them (they gain no benefice, but still have to pay the cost) and it becomes an additional Needs. (The player and the GM determines together which part of the Being the activity affects if unmet.)\nAs long as the addiction counts as a Need for a character, that character is considered Addicted and all the Addicted supplementary effects of the activity applies to them.\nCuring an Addiction\nMainly, an addiction is cured by refraining from indulging it for a sufficient amount of time. When a Needs originating from an addiction is not met two days in a row the character is considered in Withdrawal, if the character then manage to not partake in the activity for a period of time equal or greater than the withdrawal period they are considered in remission and the addiction is removed from their Needs.\nDuring the withdrawal period the character must make relapse checks under certain circumstances and with more a less of a malus depending on the specific circumstance.\nA withdrawal check is made in the same manner as the original addiction check. The GM can add or remove to the difficulty depending on circumstances.\n\nDescription\nPenalty\n\nPeriodical check\nSome activities ask for a periodical relapse check during withdrawal.\n0\n\nIdea check\nWhen something in the environment of the character reminds them of the activity\n+4\n\nTemptation check\nWhen the opportunity to partake in the activity is directly presented to the character.\n+8\n\nOf course the GM and players are encouraged to find creative alternative ways to cure a character's addiction. They might want to try to get rid of their drinking habit by instead going for a walk with a friend or finding a new hobby. As a GM consider giving bonus on the relapse checks when players come up with alternatives way to manage or heal their character's addiction.\nAdditional Effect of Damage\nSome attacks can afflict characters with some staus conditions. Usually an additional condition from an attack can be avoided by Resisting the attack. (Text of specific attacks override the general rule.)\n\nMind (reduces focus)\nCondition\nBody (reduces endurance)\nCondition\nSpirit (reduces resilience)\nCondition\n\nConfusion\nBewildered\nPiercing / Slashing\nBleeding\nFear\nAfraid\n\nOblivion\nOblivious\nBludgeoning / Force\nBroken bones\nCharm\nCharmed\n\nPsychic\nIrrational\nFire / Heat / Lightning\nBurning\nDespair\nDepressed\n\nCold / Ice\nFreezing\nAnxiety\nPanicked\n\nAcid\nCorroding\n\nPoison\nPoisoned\nPoison\nPoisoned\nPoison\nPoisoned\n\nConditions\n\nEffect\nDescription At the start of their turn the target\nEnds\n\nBewildered\nNeeds to spend 2 focus !<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">15</a> points or they are too confused to be able to take a decision and don't act on their turn.\nRegains at least 1 focus point.\n\nBleeding\nLooses 1 endurance !<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">15</a> at the start of their turn.

		"content": "Rest, Resourcing Activities and Downtime\nRules for recovery in the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/neldar-system/\">Neldar System</a>.\nRest and Needs\n\nThe main way to recover focus , endurance and resilience is by Resting.\nA Rest includes eating food for the day and sleeping. Once a Rest is done everyone check their needs and whether or not they have fulfilled them. Each need is linked to one part of the Being and will dictate which recovery die will be rolled. If a need is unmet, the recovery die for the specific resource will be one category lower (a 1d6 would become a 1d4).\nThe result of the recovery die is added to the current value of the resource.\n\nNeed\nPart of the Being\nResource\n\nSunlight\nMind\nFocus\nFatigue\n\nFood and water\nBody\nEndurance\nExhaustion\n\nSleep and/or Dream\nSpirit\nResilience\nStress\n\nAfter each rest, the values of fatigue, exhaustion and stress level are divided by 2 (rounded down.)\nFor each need that was not fulfiled, the fatigue, exhaustion or stress value is only decremented by 1.\n\nAyrina has a Mind score of 3, Body score of 5 and a Spirit score of 4. Her recovery dice are 2d6, 2d8 and 2d6 respectively.\nShe had spent the day exploring dark caves and passages, thus her need for sunlight was not met, but she had plenty to eat and was able to sleep.\nThis means that she will roll her full dice for her endurance (Body) and resilience (Spirit) : 2d8 and 2d6, but for her focus (Mind) she will only be able to roll 2d4 (1 category of die less than her recovery dice of 2d6).\nAt the end of the day she had : 5 focus , 4 endurance and 6 resilience . In the morning she will roll her recovery dice and regain :\nMind : 2d4, she gets a total of 3 her new value of focus for the day is 8.\nBody : 2d8, she gets a total of 9 her new value of endurance for the day is 13.\nSpirit : 2d6, she gets a total of 7 her new value of resilience for the day is 12. (She cannot go over her resilience maximum which is 3 times her Spirit socre : 12)\n\nResourcing Activities\nSome activities can replenish one resource for some cost. The cost can be other resources, time or simply money. Each resourcing activity is personal to each character, their cost and benefit may vary from character to character.\nOne character might be greatly helped focusing by drinking coffee, but not really tolerate the acidity of the beverage thus gaining a +1d4 focus and a -2 endurance when drinking a cup.\nAn other one might tolerate the acidity well but becoming a little bit agitated gaining a +1d4 to focus and a -2 to resilience .\nA nice walk in nature might gives you a +1d4 to resilience and a +2 to focus while costing you only 2 endurance , but to complete this activity you need at least 1 hour and access to nature or a park.\n\n[!gm] Advice for GMs\nAs the adventure progress it is advised to emphasis to your players the discovery or creation of new Resourcing Activities for their characters. Activities that help them with their Permanent Injuries and tie into their character's narrative arc.\nThe idea of this game is to keep going, healing what can be healed and learning to manage what cannot.\n\nRule of thumb for creating Resourcing Activities\n\n[!wip] Work in Progress\nThis is still a work in progress, the specifics values might change\n\nCosts Benefits\n-2 resource +1d4

resource\n\nDowntime\nThere are 3 main downtime activities:\n\nTrain a skill\nStudy a language\nWork for money\n\nTraining\nTraining a skill allows to gain a free skill point after a period of intense dedicated training.\nThe numbers of days depend on the next skill rank.\n\nform-to (skill rank)\nnumber of day\ntime (iris calendar*)\n\n0-1\n7\n1 week\n\n1-2\n28\n1 month\n\n2-3\n112\n4

href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/cultures/calendars/iris-calendar/\">Iris Calendar</a>, 1 month = 28 day and there is 13 months + 1 day in a year\n\nStudy\nThe number of day of dedicated study to learn a new language depends on its difficulty relative to the languages you already now.\nIf the new language you want to learn is in the same language tree as a language you already now, then this language is considered to be an easy one for you, otherwise it's a hard language.\n(See. <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\"

weeks\n\nHard\n301\n10 months and 3 weeks\n\nWorking\nOnce you have decided on the job that you will be performing during the downtime period, select with your Storyteller the skill and attrivbute that would apply.\nThe Story teller will then give you an expected average amount and a difficulty.\nRoll for each day of downtime (or week or month, if downtime is very long) and count your accumulated success.\nThe formula belove will give you the amount of money you managed to make during downtime.\n\nFormula :\n\n#mjx-81f1614{\ndisplay:contents;\nmjx-assistive-mml {\nuser-select: text

It is the type of magic the Player Characters can have access to if they choose to.\nA practitioner of magic can only have a limited number of active spells at any given time. This number is dictated by their rank in the Arcane Magic skill.\n\nNumber of parallel spells = Arcane Magic Rank - 1\n\nSpells are constructed by combining different runes together.\nRunes\nThere exists 6 different type of runes :\n\nVerb : Will inform how the spell will interact with the world.\n\nDamage : Will do damage depending on the Element and the Potency runes\nHinder : Will Hinder the Target(s) in some way. The exact effects depend on the Element rune.\nProtect : Will Protect the Target(s) against something.\nEnhance : Will Enhance an ability of the Target(s).\nHeal : Will Heal the Target(s) in some way.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Element</a> : Different Elements will synergise differently depending on the verb used. Doing damage of this Element when combined with a Damage verb rune or protecting against it when combine with a Protect verb rune.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Potency</a> : The number and type of dice rolled or a raw value. Can differ depending on the verb used.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Range</a> (optional) : How far away from yourself can you put the origin point of the spell. If not provided the spell can only be cast on oneself.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Target</a> : The number of creatures that can be targeted or the area of effect of the spell.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Sustain</a> (optional) : For a spell to last more than the number of turns provided, a Sustain rune is needed. The type of Sustain can be Active, requiring an action to be kept active, Passive only requiring the sustain cost to be paid, but no action or Movable allowing the use of an action to move the spell somewhere else in range. The sustain cost is the amount of focus that the spellcaster must pay to keep the spell active. It can be 5, 2 or 1 focus. If a spellcaster takes damages while sustaining a spell, they must succeed a Resist check to be able to keep it.\n\nDifficulty\nIn addition to its type and value, each runes also has a difficulty cost. The sum of the difficulty cost of the runes will dictate the total difficulty of the spell. The caster must roll equal or higher than that number to successfully cast the spell.\nThe number the caster rolled will be the difficulty for anyone trying to Deflect or Resist the spell effects.\nThe target can choose to Deflect or Resist the effects of the spell unless the caster increase the total spell Difficulty by 1 to force the target to Deflect or by 2 to force the target to Resist.\nSome runes might also have a prerequisite. This prerequisite represent the minimum rank in Arcane Magic that a spellcaster must have to be able to use this rune.\nRaw Magic\nRaw magic is the type of magic based on instinct and emotions. That's the type of magic used by creatures that are naturally magical. Raw magic, by nature is less structured and almost unpredictable.\n\n[!gm] Creature Abilities\nSince creature abilities are justified by Raw Magic, it is mainly an excuse for the GM to do whatever they want with them ;)\nWant a creatures whose laugh deals Anxiety Damage to everyone that hears it ?

Sadly each government was convinced that the disappearances of their ships was due to the sabotage of their rivals and thus, they kept sending more and better equipped ships to the new island.\nTales of gigantic monsters and cursed waters started to spread among the sailors and soon t became harder and harder to find volunteers agreeing to set sail for the island who was now known as &quot;Húnatol&quot; the Cursed Island.\nThe high cost of those expeditions combined with the lack of positive results finally convinced the various governments to stop sending new ships to the island and on a tacit common accord the whole affair was quietly forgotten.\nThis happened 15 years ago. You were part of one of those hapless expeditions that find themselves stranded on Húnatol.\nSince then, survivor from every origin have set aside their differences and banded together to make a life for themselves on the island or find a way to leave it.\n\nThe survivors founded the village of I Gobel near the only source of fresh water on the island. I Ael, a mysterious lake that has no apparent stream feeding it nor river coming from it. All sources of water other  than  I Ael are foul. Poisonous for humanoïds and animals these waters can barely sustain plant life.\nWood is a rare commodity, fishing boats and tools were made or gathered from the various shipwrecks, but there are no tree sturdy and big enough to be able to build a ship capable of braving the treacherous waters around the island.\nThe west of the island is cover in low sturdy bushes and shrubs that seem to absorb as much moisture from the air as they do from the soil. Not good to eat, but good enough to make fiber for fishing nets.\nA group of hopeful druids and nature experts is trying to grow bigger trees in the center of the island. Those trees could be used to start building bigger ships in what seem a very distant future.\nThere are strange things on the island and various signs of a long dead civilisation. Eerie ruins in a perpetual fog sit on the North West of Húnatol while the South is covered in ash and petrified dead trees. Stinking winds comes from the South West were a field of dead seagrass, algea and fish carcasses still rot in the sun.\nRecently, what seem to be an ancient coal mine has been discovered near I Gobel, some want to exploit it as fuel is limited, but other think that the ancient mines should be condemn as they claim to ear the screaming and wailing of the dead coming from it on moonless night.\nWith so many people coming from so many different places and speaking different languages,  forced to collaborate, a new language was quickly formed : Lam Lammain or the Tongue of Tongues usually simple called I Lam, The Tongue.\nInhabitants\n\nUrix (they/them) is an old black Dragonén, probably the older inhabitant of the island. They are an ex-priest of Syrinx and have taken the mentle of spiritual guide of the Island. After an almost catastrophic crisis of bielif during the first years of living on the island, Urix has since become open to all the different religions of the survivors. They have learn from each one and have compile a sort of universal guide of belief of the island.\nTudo (she/her) a Borang (Tortoise Person) from Thandnur, Nelki (they/them) a Caerang (Crocodile Person) from Uruithel,  Odax (he/him) a Kobold from Calendôr are three nature expert (shaman, botanist, druid) that form an alliance with the sole goal to one day grow trees big enough to make ship capable of leaving the island. They have planted some trees on the West part of the island in a place the is now simply called In Eryn (the Trees). The three of them know that they probably won't live to see the day those ships will sail, but they are determine to take care of the tree while they live and transmit their knowledge to the future generations. They call themselves the Eryndili.\nWandering Leaf Folium (they/them) an Aranlin (a falcon person with bright yellow feathers) from Silva Ultimus (Uruithel) they are the only of the survivor capable of flight. They are not capable to fly long enough to traverse the sea, but they did carefully explore the island from the sky and act as a fast messenger between I Gobel  (the Village) and In Eryn (The Trees).\nSsaashek (they/them) an Angessë (Lizard Person) from Rancanad, they are the leader of the Synia Heren the group that act as guards/policeforce/enforcers of the island.\nRendar (he/him) Orc from Rhuk is an ex-soldier, he was offered a role in the Synia Heren, but declined admitting that the military life was not for him, quite young at the time he is now in charge of the children born on the island and act as their teacher. He is engaged to Karrog (he/him) also an Orc from Rhuk. The two of them don't want to get back to Rhuk, they rather live together on the island no matter how harsh the conditions.\nBaruk (she/her) Dwarf from Gabil-Zirak the de facto stone expert.\nOrnis (she/her) a Hólin (Owl Person) from Calendôr, she broke her wing when the ship she was in sink near the island and was not able to fly since then.\nYreenea (she/her) a Gnoll from Côfûl. Gnolls are really rare. Even people from Côfûl don't necessarily know about them.\nThôrzîran (he/him) a Goblin from Côfûl, he seems to know everything about everybody. He doesn't spread gossip, but he sure will listen !\nLithidion (they/them) sapphire Dragonén from Eretol, right hand of Ssaashek.\nPurpura (she/her) a Behemos (sort of a Hyppo Person with purple skin) sometime simply called &quot;the Sergeant&quot; she is in charge of the day-to-day organisation of the Synia Heren.\nSluk (he/him) an Aranlin from Rhuk (cannot fly)\nLeukon (they/them) a Hólin from Calendôr (unsure if they can fly, nobody has seen them fly though)\nAimaxy  (she/her) a red Dragonén from Baramlug",

The Prince of Nelatar is only known by his title and only those close to him use his name to address him.\nThe Prince and his Court live in Nelataren the capital, built on an island in the middle of the Kagami river.\n\nThe Principality is separated in five Provinces : Western, Northern, Eastern, Southern and Central.\nThe Western Province is under the influence of the Temple of Ordel who has is siege in the city of Ordelen, capital of the Province.\nMost of the lands of the Eastern Province have now fallen under Egerot occupation, including the rich merchant city and capital of the Province, Maralen.\nThe capital city of the Southern Province, Vierna is renown for its wine production, which seems like an impossible feat given the local climate.\nLastly the capital of the Northern Province recently changed from Avorel to <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/places/serna/\">Serna</a>.\n\n[!sys] System Details\nThe long winter and short days of Nelatar might impact the need for sun of the characters. (see. <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/rest-resourcing-activities-and-downtime/#d14e53\">Rest and Needs</a>)\nThe characters are also more likley to encounter snow terrains. (see. <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-system/rules/terrain-and-environment/#94cb9d\">Terrain</a>)\n\nLanguages\nPeople in the Principality speaks Nessegarian, the same <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/languages/languages/\">language</a> that is spoken in Egerot.\nSome scholar of the Temple still learn Old Nessalian as most of the ancient religious texts are written in this language.\nNames\nIn their first years of life, people from Nelatar have a &quot;Child Name&quot; usually given by their parents. On their twelve birthday, when they choose their apprenticeship, their master give them their adult name.\nOnly nobles have a family name.\nGenerally, consonant are followed by a vowel, with the notable exception of the &quot;nr&quot; and &quot;rn&quot; group.\nMasculine names tends to finish in &quot;-ro&quot; or &quot;-or&quot; (&quot;-or&quot; being the mark of an older name).\nFeminine names tends to finish in &quot;-a&quot;, &quot;-te&quot; or &quot;-i&quot; (with &quot;-i&quot; being the ancient ending).\nRecently, people in the East of Nelatar started using the ending &quot;-an&quot; as a gender neutral ending for names.\nPeople in the West and in the Temple still understand this ending as a masculine one though.\nCurrency\nThe Nelataran currency is the daer. It's a based 12 system (like their counting system)\n1 Lodaer = 12 Daers\n1 Daer = 12 Daerins\n1 Daerin\nReligion\nFor a long time, Nelatar shared the same pantheon of gods and goddesses that <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Egerot </a>worship (the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/religions/chtonien-celestial-pantheon/\">Chtonien-Celestial Pantheon</a>), but over time, the Temple of Ordel grew in power and tried to erased the others gods/goddess. They believe in the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/cosmologies/the-one-world-cosmology/\">The One World Cosmology</a>.\nThe Temple was fairly successful in doing so in the Capital and the Western Province.\nOver the past century, a significant resurgence in the beliefs and ancient practices as been seen in the Eastern Province.\nIn reaction, the Temple of Ordel has made illegal any practice tied to the ancient gods and even pronouncing their name is forbidden.\nThe Temple of Ordel is the religious organisation that has detained true power of Nelatar over the past centuries. There siege is found in the capital city of the Western Province, Ordelen.\nThey are lead by the Grand Priest and his two advisors his Right and Left Hands. It is rumoured that the Left Hand of the Grand Priest is nothing more than his personal assassin, though sometime the position has been used by Grand Priest to keep a political enemy in check. The Left Hand having close to no actual power as opposed to the Right Hand.\nThe Temple is firmly opposed to the Masked Ones, a group of people that started to appear less than a century ago in the East. The Masked One tried to re-awaken the ancient beliefs in multiples divine powers, slowly undermining the authority of the Temple.\nThe Temple made it illegal to even pronounce the names of the ancient gods.\nThe colours of Ordel, and by extension the Temple, are the white and light blue.\nEvery Priest and apprentice receives a light blue cape from the Temple, upon their ordination.\nFolklore\nThree Hags\nThree old women in the wilderness are considered to be hags. They are to be avoided if possible or help with their tasks otherwise, but no reward or gift should be accepted from them.\nAn old saying goes :\n&quot;One old woman in the wood, it's the healer looking for plants.\nTwo of them, they are exchanging the town gossip.\nBut if it is three that you see, woe to you! &quot;\nThe night washerwomen\nsee <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/places/egerot/#2bb3f0\">Egerot - The Night Washerwomen</a>\nGames\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/cultures/games/best-die/\">Best Die</a> played with a d12 where 1 is seen as the best result.\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/cultures/games/the-werewolf-s-hunt/\">The Werewolf's Hunt</a> played with a subset of the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/cultures/games/neledhir/\">Neledhîr</a> deck.\nCalendar\nNelatar and Egerot share the same calendar( see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/cultures/calendars/nelatar-egerot-calendar/\">Nelatar-Egerot Calendar</a>)",

The Church wants to take the lake Taenaelin under their control since it's a holy site of their faith.\nSince the Orc birthrate is roughly 3 males for 1 female, every male Orc has to prove himself in battle before earning the right to get a wife.\nMale Orcs have also the choice to enter the service of the Church where they can also &quot;earn&quot; a wife if their elders deemed them devoted enough.\nThe Menelhîn is the name the Aranlindir of Rhuk give themselves. Without their knowledge, the Orcs &quot;clip&quot; the wings of every Aranlindir newborn as soon as they've hatched.\nWithout cutting their wings entirely, they cut the main muscle rendering them incapable of flight for their entire life.\nThe Menelhîn culture has been almost entirely erased by the Church of Kâtha-Attû, but the Aranlindir have developed a secret way to communicate with each other.\nA secret language called Linifir composed of chirps and clicks that the Orcs mistake for meaningless bird songs.\nIn this language they tell each other how they are the children of the sky and once were flying high above the lands and the sea and they address prayers to their ancestral father Roval and their ancestral mother Tuilinn.\nThe Zînâhin\nThe Zînâhin is an organisation started be Orc women and non-binary to oppose the Church of Kâtha-Attû.\nThey share tales of their forgotten goddess Zînâ (sometime called Zîrîna) and secretly practice rituals in her honour.\nThe Zînâhin quickly started to accept Orc men in their numbers, any who oppose the current rule of the Church or the Patriarchy is welcomed. What started as religious rebellion has become a political fight.\nLanguages\nThe official language of Rhuk is Rhukethet, but the multiple communities of Dwarves often still speak Zondolk (or even sometime Ondolk).\nThe Aranlindir speak and sing Linifir and the isolated Gnolls villages speak Gnewic.\nCalendar\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/cultures/calendars/rhuk-calendar/\">Rhuk Calendar</a>",

Lorneth's port is the biggest of the whole known world.\nCultures\nWork In Progress : Main Uruitheli culture\nIn the center of Uruithel East is the jungle of Silva Ultimus.

People of Silvola speak Mewithen. Turuvir is a dialect spoken by some of the Borangedir.\nCurrency\n\n1 Domus = 6 Somnus\n1 Somnus = 6 Morder\n1 Morder = 6 Biben\n1 Biben\nHistorically 1 Biben was enough for a drink, 1 Morder was enough for a bite to eat, 1 Somnus was enough for 1 night of sleep in an inn and 1 domus was enough for a home. Values have changed since then but the names have stuck around. The coins are made of bronze with representations of people eating/drinking/sleeping or homes depending on their values.\nCalendar\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/neldardhen-world/endea/cultures-nations/cultures/calendars/uruithel-calendar/\">Uruithel Calendar</a>",
