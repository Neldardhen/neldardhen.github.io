# Crafting System
The Crafting System is made of two elements, the Recipes and the Ingredients.

A Recipe list an item as the base result and different requirements in the form of tags.

>A long sword require any ingredient tagged as Wood for the handle and any ingredient marked as Metal for the blade. Any ingredient tagged as Leather can also optionally added to the handle.

PCs gather the ingredients which in addition to their respective tags can also have some modifiers.

>A White Dragon Scale has the tags Dragon, Scale and the modifiers of gain Ice Immunity when applied on an Armour.

## Crafting check
Recipes have a base crafting difficulty that can be modified by the ingredient applied.

>The crafting difficulty for a Scale Armour is 8, but using Dragon Scales to craft it will increase the difficulty by an other 8 for a total of 16.

The Crafting check is made as any other skill check, using Crafts on Physics. On a failure the ingredients are lost, but on a success a new item is created.
The item is the base item of the recipe with the modifiers from each ingredients apply to it.

## Infusions
Some advanced Recipes allows for Infusions. An infusion is always optional and requires a character to have an Arcane Magic skill of at least 2 to be performed.

Infusions allows to add some extra magical proprieties to an item with some more esoteric ingredient.
