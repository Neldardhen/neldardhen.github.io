# Orcs
*Orc, plur. Orcs*

![Lorta-bust.png|100](/img/user/Images/Species/Lorta-bust.png)

Orcs are a [[Neldardhen World/Species/Species\|Species]] of big bulky humanoids with greenish skin. They are mainly found on the eastern side of the Palanian continent, but their cultures are all but uniform.

Approximately three males orc are born for every female, both of their main cultures (the patriarchy of Rhuck and the matriarchy of Urîdzâyan) are centred around this fact.

Descendants of the Hobcors who came long ago from the night world of Nyalë, they are related to Hobgoblins and Goblins, but do not necessarily always get along well with them.

#### Reproduction
Like all the [[Neldardhen World/Species/Gremns\|Gremns]] descendants, Orcs mixes their blood with clay and then shape a statuette out of it that will become the new baby.


#### System Details
Orcs are a [[Neldardhen System/Character Creation/Playable Species List\|Playable Species]].
