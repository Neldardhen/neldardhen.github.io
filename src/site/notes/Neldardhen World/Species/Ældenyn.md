There exist three different clans of Ældenyns with vastly different ways of living.

Stareyes live in beautiful and comfortable cites, pursuing knowledge and magic.

Silkhands dedicate their lives to art, craft and technologies.

Daggerfangs lives in small communauties of hunter gatherers they are focused on living their lives "in the moment" guided by their emotions.
#### Reproduction
Little is known about the reproduction rituals of Ældenyn. All that is know from non-elves is that young Ældenyn emerge from trees.

Their skin stay bark-like for a few years until it becomes gradually smoother with age.
"Being hard-skinned" is an expression implaying young age and lack of experience.
