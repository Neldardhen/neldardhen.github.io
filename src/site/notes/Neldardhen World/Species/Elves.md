# Elves
*Elf, plur. Elves*

![Glirmegil-closeup.png|100](/img/user/Images/Species/Glirmegil-closeup.png)

Elves or [[Neldardhen World/Species/Ælven\|Ælven]] are a [[Neldardhen World/Species/Species\|Species]]  result of [[Neldardhen World/Cosmologies/The Projection\|The Projection]] of  the [[Ældir\|Ældir]] to [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Endëa\|Endëa]]. 

Generally a little bit smaller and thinner than Humans, their skin tones range from dark grey to pale green. Elves living in hotter and dryer climate can even have brownish or yellow skin. Their hair can also have a greenish tint.

Elves prefer to live in forested areas and rarely build cities. Sensitive to magic and nature they are often considered as weird or strange by the other species of the world.
They can be found in [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Alfir\|Alfir]], the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Findelythrim Forest\|Findelythrim Forest]], the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Rhauwrim Forest\|Rhauwrim Forest]] and [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Algassia\|Algassia]].
#### Reproduction
Little is known about the reproduction rituals of elves. All that is know from non-elves is that young elves emerge from trees.

Their skin stay bark-like for a few years until it becomes gradually smoother with age.
"Being hard-skinned" is an expression implaying young age and lack of experience.

Elves are a [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Character Creation/Playable Species List\|Playable Species]].
