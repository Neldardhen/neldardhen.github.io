Ælamar cities are elegantly designed and filled with fountains, trees and flowers.
#### Reproduction
Little is known about the reproduction rituals of Ælamar. All that is know from non-elves is that young Ælamar emerge from trees.

Their skin stay bark-like for a few years until it becomes gradually smoother with age.
"Being hard-skinned" is an expression implaying young age and lack of experience.
