# Dwarves
*Dwarf, plur. Dwarves*

![Beriagond.png|100](/img/user/Images/Species/Beriagond.png)

Dwarves are a [[Neldardhen World/Species/Species\|Species]] of smaller bulky humanoids native from [[Neldardhen World/Amaurëa/Amaurëa\|Amaurëa]], but now living in [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Endëa\|Endëa]]. They have adapted to the eternal sun of Amaurëa by going underground. When they fled their native world they did not felt the need to change their new habit and established themselves in the mountains. They have thick hair and beards (trait shared by both male and female dwarves).

Their different societies tend to be hierarchical with an emphasis on strength of body, mind and spirit. The two main Dwarven Kingdoms are [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Fulk-Gathol\|Fulk-Gathol]] in the North of the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Continents/Palanian Continent\|Palanian Continent]] and [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Gabil-Zirak\|Gabil-Zirak]] in the South.

#### Reproduction
Each parent magically fuse one of their hair to a small stone carving. The stone statuette is then safely enclosed in a nattural geodes where it can grow.

The growth and developement of a stone statuette into a baby dwarf is extremely slow.  
Dwarves often gather outside of the geodes where children are growing to sing and play music.

Dwarves are a [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Character Creation/Playable Species List\|Playable Species]].
