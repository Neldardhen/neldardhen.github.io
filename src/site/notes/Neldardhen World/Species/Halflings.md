Halflings are a [[Neldardhen World/Species/Species\|Species]] of smaller humanoids native from [[Neldardhen World/Amaurëa/Amaurëa\|Amaurëa]], but now living exclusively [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Endëa\|Endëa]]. They have lived in Endëa for so long that they themselves have forgotten their native world. They are the best adapted of the the outsiders species.

Small humanoids with hairy feet, they mixed quickly with the humans and build most of their civilisation alongside them.

Halflings enjoy the simpler life but are particularly brave in the face of danger.
