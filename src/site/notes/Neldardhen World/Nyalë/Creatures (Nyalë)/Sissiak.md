# Sissiak
Sissiaks are [[Neldardhen World/Nyalë/Creatures (Nyalë)/Creatures from Nyalë\|Creatures from Nyalë]] made from light.

The [[Neldardhen World/Species/Tyndir\|Tyndir]] of [[Neldardhen World/Nyalë/Nyalë\|Nyalë]] decided to let go of their physical form, those who made a pact with the moonlight became the Sissiak.

The Sissiaks that are still interacting with the physical worlds regret their choice and are trying to get a physical body back, they will try to make fair deals with other sentient beings in exchange for sharing with them their bodies.

A Sissiak who manage to trick a sentient being into giving them their body becomes a [[Neldardhen World/Species/Shinrens\|Shinrens]].
The Shinren resulting from the union is an entirely new creature with their own new Mind, Body and Spirit. They might or not retain some memories form both of their previous lives.
