# Daessiak
Daessiaks are [[Neldardhen World/Nyalë/Creatures (Nyalë)/Creatures from Nyalë\|Creatures from Nyalë]] made from shadows.

The [[Neldardhen World/Species/Tyndir\|Tyndir]] of [[Neldardhen World/Nyalë/Nyalë\|Nyalë]] decided to let go of their physical form, those who made a pact with the shadows became the Daessiaks. 

The Daessiaks that are still interacting with the physical worlds regret their choice and are trying to get a physical body back, they will try to negotiate and trick other sentient beings into giving them or sharing with them their bodies.

A Daessiak who manage to trick a sentient being into giving them their body becomes an [[Neldardhen World/Species/Umbrans\|Umbrans]]
The Umbran resulting from the union is an entirely new creature with their own new Mind, Body and Spirit. They might or not retain some memories form both of their previous lives.
