# Mydroians Cultures

In most [[Neldardhen World/Species/Mydroians\|Mydroian]] cultures, the number 4 play an important role either as a symbol or superstition.
4 individual are required to create a new Mydroian life. They have also separated their life in 4 main phases which can be roughly translated as : Childhood, The Training Years (sometime call "The Sharpening"), The Learning Years and The Working Years.

Most culture are based on the traditional roles and work assign depending on each Mydroian type.

**Goldskins** are traditionally leaders, kings, generals, legislators or rulers. They are also priests in religious societies.

**Bronzeskin** are warriors or workers in fields taht necessitate great strength of body.

**Copperskin** are artisans, workers in fields that require precision or finesse or that are close to the earth.

**Brass-skin** are servant or workers that provide services.

In different societies, the same role could be seen as being appropriate for a different kind of Mydroian. Some societies sees barber-surgeons as being providers of a service and therefore a profession for Brass-skin while other societies might see the profession as being in need of percision and therefore more appropriate for a Copperskin.

### The Hepatizon/Shakudô
These Mydroians with a naturally dark purple skin are thought to be a rare variant of a Goldskin or a Bronzeskin (depending on who you ask...)
They are usually pushed to take the same roles and appearances of the Goldskin.

Through a process call deplation gliding that involved spreading an acidic solution on one's own skin, an Hepatizon Mydroian can take the appaerance of a Goldskin. The process is painful, but is often required in most Mydroian societies.

## The Gold Lead 
Main culture in most of the Mydroian societies.
Families are formed with one Goldskin who is the authority figure and three Mydorians of any other type.
### The Equilibrium
Variant of the Gold Lead culture, households are formed with one Mydroian of each type.
In those families the Brass-skin is responsible for all children during their childhood. They are then in training with the Bronzeskin memebr of the family during their Training Years and they will finally join the member of the family with the same skin as theirs during their Learning Years.
## The Homogenous
Households are formed by Mydroian of the same type exclusively.
During their Trainings Years and Learning Years, the children are sent to specialised schools.

## The Bronze Strength
This culture follow the same idea as the Gold Lead except that the Bronzeskinn take the role of authority in the household.

## The Alloy
A slowy growing culture in a society where traditional roles have been transcended or abandoned. 
Any Mydroian is free to form a familly with any others and to adopt any role in society that they see fit for themself.
