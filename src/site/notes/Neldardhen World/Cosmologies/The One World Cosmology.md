### The Underworld Entrance
The entrance to the Land after Death is believe to be a physical place in the world. It is describe as a cave  found in a land where there is no winter. The cave itself exhale the breath of death as a white heavy gas.

This cave indeed exists and is located somewhere where the mountains meet the sea in Southern Lobor. 
The white gas is carbon dioxide released by underground geological activities, local priest still practice animal sacrifice by leading the animals into the cave and letting them breath there. The human who stand higher then the animals can survive as the carbon dioxide is heavier than normal air and sikns to the bottom. Small birds are killed with a single breath.
