Three fundamental Energies are recognised : Heat, Cold (not shown above, respectively on the far left and far right) and Life that act on two fundamental state of matter Rock and Air or Void (not shown either, respectively at the bottom and top pf the graph).

Heat and Cold interacting with Rock and Air create the four outside elements Lightning, Wind, Magma and Ice.
When those elements interact with the Energy of Life, Fire, Sky, Water and Earth are created and plant and animal life becomes possible.
