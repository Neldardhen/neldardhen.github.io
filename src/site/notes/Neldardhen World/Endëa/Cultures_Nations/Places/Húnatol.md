# Húnatol
{ #62609b}


_Main location of the [[Neldardhen System/Adventures/The Cursed Island/The Cursed Island\|The Cursed Island]] [[Neldardhen System/Adventures/Adventures\|Adventure]]._

In the year 1917 of the Flowering Age, a new island suddenly appeared in the middle of the Enedaeron ocean.

Delegations and expeditions from Côfûl, Rhuk, Uruithel, Baramlug, Rancanad, Thandnûr and even Calendôr and Eretol.

The treacherous waters and aquatic monsters around the island often meant that this was a one way trip. Sadly each government was convinced that the disappearances of their ships was due to the sabotage of their rivals and thus, they kept sending more and better equipped ships to the new island.

Tales of gigantic monsters and cursed waters started to spread among the sailors and soon t became harder and harder to find volunteers agreeing to set sail for the island who was now known as "Húnatol" the Cursed Island.
The high cost of those expeditions combined with the lack of positive results finally convinced the various governments to stop sending new ships to the island and on a tacit common accord the whole affair was quietly forgotten.

This happened 15 years ago. You were part of one of those hapless expeditions that find themselves stranded on Húnatol.
Since then, survivor from every origin have set aside their differences and banded together to make a life for themselves on the island or find a way to leave it.

The survivors founded the village of _I Gobel_ near the only source of fresh water on the island. _I Ael_, a mysterious lake that has no apparent stream feeding it nor river coming from it. All sources of water other  than  _I Ael_ are foul. Poisonous for humanoïds and animals these waters can barely sustain plant life.

Wood is a rare commodity, fishing boats and tools were made or gathered from the various shipwrecks, but there are no tree sturdy and big enough to be able to build a ship capable of braving the treacherous waters around the island.

The west of the island is cover in low sturdy bushes and shrubs that seem to absorb as much moisture from the air as they do from the soil. Not good to eat, but good enough to make fiber for fishing nets.  
  
A group of hopeful druids and nature experts is trying to grow bigger trees in the center of the island. Those trees could be used to start building bigger ships in what seem a very distant future.

There are strange things on the island and various signs of a long dead civilisation. Eerie ruins in a perpetual fog sit on the North West of Húnatol while the South is covered in ash and petrified dead trees. Stinking winds comes from the South West were a field of dead seagrass, algea and fish carcasses still rot in the sun.

Recently, what seem to be an ancient coal mine has been discovered near _I Gobel,_ some want to exploit it as fuel is limited, but other think that the ancient mines should be condemn as they claim to ear the screaming and wailing of the dead coming from it on moonless night.

With so many people coming from so many different places and speaking different languages,  forced to collaborate, a new language was quickly formed : _Lam Lammain_ or the Tongue of Tongues usually simple called _I Lam_, The Tongue.
