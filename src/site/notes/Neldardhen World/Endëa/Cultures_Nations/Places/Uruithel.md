The Uruithelî are the first to have discovered and democratised the use of firearms. The nation is led by three Counts : the Count of the West, the Count of the East and the Count of the Seas.
Believing themselves superior to all other nations, they started to expand their empire in a great effort of colonisation.
Even if they lost their most recent colony of [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Thandnûr\|Thandnûr]], many of the natives people  (mainly [[Borangedir\|Borangedir]]) have been emigrating to the cities of Uruithel. Most of them found employment as house servants, paid a misery, they take care of the task the Uruithelî find to be beneath them.
The Borangedir living in Uruithel, if not slaves, are still considered second class citizens.

**Inrast** is were the Count of the East lives and where the Society of Archaeology built the First Museum.
The First Museum contains a vast collection of objects and scrolls taken from the ruins and tombs of Laugsuil.
The Museum has a couple of rooms dedicated to the "Curiosities of the far East", filled with day to day objects used by the Borangedir in Thandnûr.

**Lorneth** is politically considered outside of Uruithel East since it belongs to the Count of the Seas. Lorneth's port is the biggest of the whole known world.
