Believing themselves superior to all other nations, they started to expand their empire in a great effort of colonisation.
Even if they lost their most recent colony of [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Thandnûr\|Thandnûr]], many of the natives people  (mainly [[Borangedir\|Borangedir]]) have been emigrating to the cities of Uruithel. Most of them found employment as house servants, paid a misery, they take care of the task the Uruithelî find to be beneath them.
The Borangedir living in Uruithel, if not slaves, are still considered second class citizens.
