*Folklore*
*The Night Washerwomen*
Three women with palmed feet may appear at night washing the clothes of the recently dead or soon to be dying.
If one is seen by the washerwomen they will ask for help. They will drown the ones who refuse to help and break the arms of those who help reluctantly. They will allow those who helped them with enthusiasm to ask them three questions. They will answer those questions briefly but truthfully and then vanish.
