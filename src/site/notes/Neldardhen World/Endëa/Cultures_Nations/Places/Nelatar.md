The Principality is separated in five Provinces : Western, Northern, Eastern, Southern and Central.
The Western Province is under the influence of the Temple of Ordel who has is siege in the city of Ordelen, capital of the Province.
Most of the lands of the Eastern Province have now fallen under Egerot occupation, including the rich merchant city and capital of the Province, Maralen.
The capital city of the Southern Province, Vierna is renown for its wine production, which seems like an impossible feat given the local climate.
Lastly the capital of the Northern Province recently changed from Avorel to [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Serna\|Serna]].

### Religion
For a long time, Nelatar shared the same pantheon of gods and goddesses that [[Egerot \|Egerot ]]worship (the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Religions/Chtonien-Celestial Pantheon\|Chtonien-Celestial Pantheon]]), but over time, the Temple of Ordel grew in power and tried to erased the others gods/goddess. They believe in the [[Neldardhen World/Cosmologies/The One World Cosmology\|The One World Cosmology]].
The Temple was fairly successful in doing so in the Capital and the Western Province.
Over the past century, a significant resurgence in the beliefs and ancient practices as been seen in the Eastern Province.
In reaction, the Temple of Ordel has made illegal any practice tied to the ancient gods and even pronouncing their name is forbidden.

The Temple of Ordel is the religious organisation that has detained true power of Nelatar over the past centuries. There siege is found in the capital city of the Western Province, Ordelen.
They are lead by the Grand Priest and his two advisors his Right and Left Hands. It is rumoured that the Left Hand of the Grand Priest is nothing more than his personal assassin, though sometime the position has been used by Grand Priest to keep a political enemy in check. The Left Hand having close to no actual power as opposed to the Right Hand.
The Temple is firmly opposed to the Masked Ones, a group of people that started to appear less than a century ago in the East. The Masked One tried to re-awaken the ancient beliefs in multiples divine powers, slowly undermining the authority of the Temple.
The Temple made it illegal to even pronounce the names of the ancient gods.
The colours of Ordel, and by extension the Temple, are the white and light blue.
Every Priest and apprentice receives a light blue cape from the Temple, upon their ordination.

*Folklore*
*Three Hags*
Three old women in the wilderness are considered to be hags. They are to be avoided if possible or help with their tasks otherwise, but no reward or gift should be accepted from them.
An old saying goes :
"One old woman in the wood, it's the healer looking for plants.
Two of them, they are exchanging the town gossip.
But if it is three that you see, woe to you! "
