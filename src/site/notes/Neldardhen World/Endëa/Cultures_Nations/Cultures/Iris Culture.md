The soul of the first dead man of the year takes the role of the Ankou for the year to come. His role is to gather the soul of the dead.

He is a humanoid skeleton clothed with only a dark cloack and travels at night with a wheelbarrow.  
Hearing a sourcless squeaking of wheel after sunset means that the Ankou has come to the home to collect a soul. One the Ankou has come to a home, he will not leave without a soul, but it doesn't matter to him which soul he departs with.

 **The Vanth**
The soul of the first dead non-binary person of the year take the role of the Vanth.

The Vanth is a white raven that accompany the Ankou. They can see through walls and are able to discern lies from truths. They act as the Ankou adviser.

**The Hecate**
The soul of the first dead woman of the year takes the role of the dreaded Hecate. The Hecate has the appearance of the rotten corpse of a beautiful woman draped in a white shroud. She comes to gather the souls of dead children and woman who dies in childbirth.
