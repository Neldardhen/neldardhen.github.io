# Character Creation - Points Distribution
The second step of [[Neldardhen System/Character Creation/Character Creation\|Character Creation]] is the points distribution.
## Fundamental Values
You have three fundamental values, your _Mind_, _Body_ and _Spirit_ and you have **12 points** to distribute between them. Each one may not be less than **1** or greater than **10**.

Every time you gain a level, you will gain **2** additional points. (see [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Progression/Character Progression\|Character Progression]])

Every even level, your maximum for your Fundamental values increases by **1**. (ie. at level 7 you would have a cap of 13. )

> *Formula : Max Fundamental = 10 + floor(level / 2)*

Your _focus maximum_ will be **3** times your _Mind_ value. Your _endurance maximum_ **3** time your _Body_ value and your _resilience maximum_ **3** times your _Spirit_ value.

Your _recovery die_ for each value will also be based on your fundamentals, following the table below.

> *Formula :  
> ceiling(x/6) + 1 **d** ceiling(x/2) * 2 - ( ( ceiling(x/6) - 1 ) * 6 + ( ceiling( x / 6 ) * 2 ) ), where x is your Fundamental value.*

| **Fundamental value**<br>(Mind, Body, Spirit) | Resource Max<br>(focus, endurance, resilience) | **Recovery die<br>** |

## Attribute dice and Skills
For each of your fundamental value, you have three Attributes. _Memory/Knowledge_, _Wits_ and _Composure_ depending on the _Mind_, _Physic_, _Reaction Speed_ and _Pain Tolerance_ depending on the _Body_ and finally _Charisame_, _Insight / Manipulation_ and _Volition_ depending on the _Spirit_.
Each attribute is associated with a dice type. 

You also have access to 18 skills.

You can spend points to increase the die of an attribute or buy rank in a skill.
You may spend **50 points** at level 1. 

Increasing an attribute die by one category (d4 -> d6) costs **5 points**. 
Increasing a skill from (**n-1**) to **n** costs **n points**. Increasing a skill from **0** to **n** costs **((n-1) * n) / 2**.
