# Optional Rules
Optional Rules ofr [[Neldardhen System/Neldar System\|Neldar System]].
## Addictions
Some Resourcing Activities might have a risk of #Addiction. The Addiction risk must be defined at the creation of the Activity by the player and the GM.

If a character indulge in such an activity at a frequency equal or above the _risk frequency_ of the activity, they must roll an addiction check.

The addiction check is always made on Volition. The maximum number of die is a fixed 3. As always the first die is free, the other two can potentially be bought with resilience.

When a character is addicted to an activity, this activity stops being a _Resourcing Activity_ for them (they gain no benefice, but still have to pay the cost) and it becomes an additional _Needs_. (The player and the GM determines together which part of the _Being_ the activity affects if unmet.)

As long as the addiction counts as a _Need_ for a character, that character is considered Addicted and all the Addicted supplementary effects of the activity applies to them.

### Curing an Addiction
Mainly, an addiction is cured by refraining from indulging it for a sufficient amount of time. When a _Needs_ originating from an addiction is not met two days in a row the character is considered in Withdrawal, if the character then manage to not partake in the activity for a period of time equal or greater than the _withdrawal period_ they are considered in remission and the addiction is removed from their _Needs_.

During the withdrawal period the character must make relapse checks under certain circumstances and with more a less of a malus depending on the specific circumstance.

A withdrawal check is made in the same manner as the original addiction check. The GM can add or remove to the difficulty depending on circumstances.

|                  | **Description**                                                                         | **Penalty** |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Periodical check | Some activities ask for a periodical relapse check during withdrawal.                   | 0           |
| Idea check       | When something in the environment of the character reminds them of the activity         | +4          |
| Temptation check | When the opportunity to partake in the activity is directly presented to the character. | +8          |

Of course the GM and players are encouraged to find creative alternative ways to cure a character's addiction. They might want to try to get rid of their drinking habit by instead going for a walk with a friend or finding a new hobby. As a GM consider giving bonus on the relapse checks when players come up with alternatives way to manage or heal their character's addiction.

## Additional Effect of Damage
Some attacks can afflict characters with some staus conditions. Usually an additional condition from an attack can be avoided by Resisting the attack. (Text of specific attacks override the general rule.)
