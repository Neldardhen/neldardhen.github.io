# Character Creation
Character Creation  rules for the  [[Neldardhen System/Neldar System\|Neldar System]].

[[Neldardhen System/Rules/Character Creation/Quick Build Reference\|Quick Build Reference]]

## Species
First you will choose your [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Character Creation/Playable Species List\|Species]].

Your species will define your character's type, perception pools and needs.

**Using Foundry**
>The different species can be found in the Item tabs. You can drag and drop your chosen species onto your character sheet.  

**Using the Character App**
> Click on the Edit button on the top left of your character sheet to enter Edit Mode, you should be able to select your Species from a dropdown button.

See [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Character Creation/Character Creation - Species\|Character Creation - Species]].

## Points Distribution
The second step is to distribute your points in your Fundamental values (Mind Body and Spirit), your Attributes and Skills.

**Using the Character App**
> Adding skill points is one of the slowest operation (because skills affects the rest of the sheet and everything must be re-calculated). So give it half a second to a second between each click.

See [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Character Creation/Character Creation - Points Distribution\|Character Creation - Points Distribution]].

## Origin and Backstory
Once you chose your Origin (see. [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Character Creation/Character Creation - Origins\|Character Creation - Origins]]) you will have a better understanding in which environment your character grew up, it can then help you write your Backstory.
This is also the step where you can choose the language you speak. You can choose 1 native language and 1 additional language per rank in your *Rhetoric / Linguistic* skill.

### Backstory
To write your backstory you can get some inspiration by answering some of the following questions :
- How do you feel about your native culture/religion ? Do you agree with the values it has taught you or do you reject its teaching ? Are those questions something you never thought to ask yourself ?
    
- Look at your Fundamentals, your Abilities and your Competences, is there one where you are really good or really bad at ? Why would it be so ? (In your youth, you spent the majority of your time studying and you hated exercising, this would explain a poor score in Body, but some better stat in _Memory_ and _Education_ )
    
- Who were the important people in your life ? Give them names. The person or people that raised you, the people you were close to but which whom you eventually fall apart, the people you are still close to, the people you hate or who hate you.
    
- Do you have dreams or long term goals ? What are your current situation and your short term goals.

## Resourcing Activities
(see also [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Rest, Resourcing Activities and Downtime\|Rest, Resourcing Activities and Downtime]])
Almost anything you will do will cost you either _focus_, _endurance_ or _resilience._ The main way to replenish those resources is to rest while having met all of your _Needs_ for the day.

Some activities can replenish one resource for some cost. The cost can be other resources, time or simple money. Each resourcing activity is personal to each character, their cost and benefice may vary from character to character.

One character might be greatly helped focusing by drinking coffee, but not really tolerate the acidity of the beverage thus gaining a **1d4** _focus_ and a **-2** _endurance_ when drinking a cup.

An other one might tolerate the acidity well but becoming a little bit agitated gaining a **+1d4** to focus and a **-2** to resilience.

A nice walk in nature might gives you a **+1d4** to _resilience_ and a **+1d4** to _focus_ while costing you only **2** _endurance_, but to complete this activity you need at least 1 hour and access to nature or a park.


### Optional Rules : Addictions
Some Activities might have a potential for Addiction (see [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Optional Rules\|Optional Rules]])  
If your character develop an addiction to the Activity then it will stop being a Resourcing Activity and instead become a new _Need_.
