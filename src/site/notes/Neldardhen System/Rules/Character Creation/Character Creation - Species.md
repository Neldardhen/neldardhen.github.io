# Character Creation - Species 
The first step of [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Character Creation/Character Creation\|Character Creation]] is to choose your [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Character Creation/Playable Species List\|Species]].
Your Species defines your character's type, perception bonuses/maluses, resistances, vulnerabilities and immunities and needs.
### Type 
Species have three different types :
- A blood type : either **Cold-blooded** or **Warm-blooded**
- A skin type : **Skin**, **Scales**, **Fur** or **Feathered**
- An environment type : **Aquatic**, **Amphibian**, **Terrestrial**, **Flying**

These type might give some advantages or disadvantages, for example a cold-blooded creature usually gains the Traits : **Ectotherm**

_As_ - species name - _you are cold-blooded this means that your body adapt (to a point) to the temperature around you._

_Creatures with Infrared perception have a harder time finding you, but you become slower when your body temperature drops below a certain point._

_You impart a **-2d6** malus on the_ Infrared Perception _check of creature trying to locate you.  
You suffer a **-1d6** on your_ Physic _and_ Reaction Speed _checks after every hour spent in an environment with a temperature below 0Â°C without appropriate clothing._

As an other example, flying Species (or Subspecies) have lighter bones than other creatures and thus usually suffer from a Bludgeoning/Force damage Vulnerability.

**Note on Flying** : When [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Terrain and Environment#^cfad21\|flying]], you need to land on solid ground or an appropriate perch to be able to do anything else than moving or talking, unless you have a specific feat like [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Progression/Species Feat#^e916e2\|Fly By Attack]] or [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Progression/Species Feat#^3f21c7\|Flying Archer]]. 
### Senses { #443e3a}

There are six main perception senses influenced by your species.

| Sense                   | description                                                | Sense              | description                            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Vision in the sun**   | Perception of colours and details in well lit environment. | **Hearing**        | Perception of sounds and ultra-sounds. |
| **Low light vision**    | Perception of movement and shape in low light.             | **Sense of smell** | Perception and distinction of smells.  |
| **Infrared perception** | Perception of the difference in temperature.               | **Magic affinity** | Perception of magic.                   |


### Resistances, Vulnerabilities, Immunities
Each Species usually gives one Resistance to a damage type. Some Subspecies gives a second Resistance or impart a Vulnerability. Immunities are extremely rare.
To learn how they are used in game see ([[Neldardhen System/Rules/Combat and Injuries#^abbeee\|Combat - Resistances, Vulnerabilities and Immunities]]).
### Needs
(see [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Basics\| Neldar System - Basics]])
There are three basics needs : sunlight exposure linked to the Mind, eating linked to the Body and dreaming/sleeping linked to the Spirit. Each one must be fulfilled in order to benefit the most from a rest. Fulfilling of needs is counted over a 24 hours period.

A need that is not fulfilled will impact a penalty on your recovery die of that type.

**Warning** : A species with a needs of zero for one category will count as having their need not fulfilled if any other of their needs has not been fulfilled either.
