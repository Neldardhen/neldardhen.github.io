# Character Creation - Points Distribution (v1)
The second step of [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Character Creation/Old v1 rules/Character Creation (v1)\|Character Creation (v1)]] is the points distribution for the [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Old v1 rules/The Neldardhen System (v1)\|The Neldardhen System (v1)]], up to date version of the system is found here : [[Neldardhen System/Neldar System\|Neldar System]].

## THIS IS AN OUTDATED VERSION see [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Character Creation/Character Creation - Points Distribution\|Character Creation - Points Distribution]]
## Fundamental Values
You have three fundamental values, your _Mind_, _Body_ and _Spirit_ and you have **12 points** to distribute between them. Each one may not be less than **1** or greater than **10**.

Every even level, your maximum for your Fundamental values increases by **1**. (ie. at level 7 you would have a cap of 13. )

> *Formula : Max Fundamental = 10 + floor(level / 2)*

Your _focus maximum_ will be **2** times your _Mind_ value. Your _endurance maximum_ **2** time your _Body_ value and your _resilience maximum_ **2** times your _Spirit_ value.

Note, since creatures don't suffer from injuries and die as soon as they reach **0** in any resources, this multiplicator becomes a **3** for them.

Your _recovery die_ for each value will also be based on your fundamentals, following the table below.

> *Formula :  
> ceiling(x/6) **d** ceiling(x/2) * 2 - ( ( ceiling(x/6) - 1 ) * 6 + ( ceiling( x / 6 ) * 2 ) ), where x is your Fundamental value.
> 
> Formula for a creature :  
> ceiling(x/6) + 1 **d** ceiling(x/2) * 2 - ( ( ceiling(x/6) - 1 ) * 6 + ( ceiling( x / 6 ) * 2 ) ), where x is your Fundamental value.*

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Fundamental value (Mind, Body or Spirit)**|**Recovery die (for focus, endurance or resilience)**|**Recovery die (for focus, endurance or resilience)  <br>for creature  <br>**|||
|1-2|1d4|2d4|||
|3-4|1d6|2d6|||
|5-6|1d8|2d8|||
|7-8|2d6|3d6|||
|9-10|2d8|3d8|||

|15-16|3d10|4d10|||
|17-18|3d12|4d12|||
|19-20|4d10|5d10|||
## Abilities
For each of your fundamental value, you have three Abilities depending on it. _Logic_, _Education_ and _Memory_ depending on the _Mind_, _Physic_, _Coordination_ and _Senses_ depending on the _Body_ and finally _Wisdom_, _Empathy_ and _Charisma_ depending on the _Spirit_.

You may distribute **100 points** between those 9 abilities, each of one being comprised between **1 and 20**. Additionally, you cannot spend more point in an Ability than your score in its corresponding Fundamental value times 2 plus 5. (ie. Logic <= 2 * Mind + 5).

## Competences
Competences are the heart of the game. You have **320 points** to distribute between all of them as long as none of the competences goes over **70**.

 ##### **Languages and Lore Knowledge**

Choosing where you spent the first part of your life will determine your native culture and language (See [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Character Creation/Character Creation - Origins\|Character Creation - Origins]]). You gain a freeÂ **40 points** in each of them and their _cost_ for a task is reduced to **1**.
