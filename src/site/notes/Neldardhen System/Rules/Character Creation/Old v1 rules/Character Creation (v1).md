# Character Creation (v1)
Character Creation  rules for  [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Old v1 rules/The Neldardhen System (v1)\|The Neldardhen System (v1)]], the up to date version can be found here : [[Neldardhen System/Neldar System\|Neldar System]].

## THIS IS AN OUTDATED VERSION see [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Character Creation/Character Creation\|Character Creation]]


[[Neldardhen System/Rules/Character Creation/Old v1 rules/Quick Build Reference (v1)\|Quick Build Reference (v1)]]

## Species

First you will choose your [[Neldardhen World/Species/Species\|Species]].

The different species can be found in the Item tabs. You can drag and drop your chosen species onto your character sheet.  
Your species will define your character's type, perception bonuses/maluses and needs.

See [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Character Creation/Character Creation - Species\|Character Creation - Species]].

## Points Distribution

The second step is to distribute your points in your Fundamental values (Mind Body and Spirit), your Abilities and your Competences.

See [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Character Creation/Old v1 rules/Character Creation - Points Distribution (v1)\|Character Creation - Points Distribution (v1)]].

## Origin and Backstory

Once you chose your Origin (see. [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Character Creation/Character Creation - Origins\|Character Creation - Origins]]) you will have a beter understanding in which environment your character grew up, it can then help you write your Backstory.

### Backstory

To write your backstory you can get some inspiration by answering some of the following questions :

- How do you feel about your native culture/religion ? Do you agree with the values it has taught you or do you reject its teaching ? Are those questions something you never thought to ask yourself ?
    
- Look at your Fundamentals, your Abilities and your Competences, is there one where you are really good or really bad at ? Why would it be so ? (In your youth, you spent the majority of your time studying and you hated exercising, this would explain a poor score in Body, but some better stat in _Memory_ and _Education_ )
    
- Who were the important people in your life ? Give them names. The person or people that raised you, the people you were close to but which whom you eventually fall apart, the people you are still close to, the people you hate or who hate you.
    
- Do you have dreams or long term goals ? What are your current situation and your short term goals.

## Resourcing Activities
#Resourcing_Activity (see also [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Recovery, Rest and Resourcing Activities\|Recovery, Rest and Resourcing Activities]])

Almost anything you will do will cost you either _focus_, _endurance_ or _resilience._ The main way to replenish those resources is to rest while having met all of your _Needs_ for the day.

Some activities can replenish one resource for some cost. The cost can be other resources, time or simple money. Each resourcing activity is personal to each character, their cost and benefice may vary from character to character.

One character might be greatly helped focusing by drinking coffee, but not really tolerate the acidity of the beverage thus gaining a **+2** _focus_ and a **-2** _endurance_ when drinking a cup.

An other one might tolerate the acidity well but becoming a little bit agitated gaining a **+1** to focus and a **-1** to resilience.

A nice walk in nature might gives you a **+4** to _resilience_ and a **+2** to _focus_ while costing you only **1** _endurance_, but to complete this activity you need at least 1 hour and access to nature or a park.


### Optional Rules : Addictions

Some Activities might have a potential for Addiction (see [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Old v1 rules/Optional Rules (v1)\|Optional Rules (v1)]])  
If your character develop an addiction to the Activity then it will stop being a Resourcing Activity and instead become a new _Need_.
