# Character Creation - Points Distribution
The second step of [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Character Creation/Character Creation\|Character Creation]] is the points distribution.
## Fundamental Values
You have three fundamental values, your _Mind_, _Body_ and _Spirit_ and you have **12 points** to distribute between them. Each one may not be less than **1** or greater than **10**.

Every time you gain a level, you will gain **2** additional points. (see [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Progression/Character Progression\|Character Progression]])

Every even level, your maximum for your Fundamental values increases by **1**. (ie. at level 7 you would have a cap of 13. )

> *Formula* : $Max Fundamental = 10 + \lfloor \frac{level}{2}\rfloor$

Your _focus ![focus.png|15](/img/user/Images/focus.png) maximum_ will be **3** times your _Mind_ value. Your _endurance ![endurance.png|15](/img/user/Images/endurance.png) maximum_ **3** time your _Body_ value and your _resilience ![resilience.png|15](/img/user/Images/resilience.png) maximum_ **3** times your _Spirit_ value.

Your _recovery dice_ for each value will also be based on your fundamentals, following the table below.

| **Fundamental value**<br>(Mind, Body, Spirit) | Resource Max<br>(focus, endurance, resilience) | **Recovery die<br>** |

>[!warning] Big Scary Formula

> *Formula* :  
 $(\lceil \frac{x}{6}\rceil + 1) d (\lceil \frac{x}{2} \rceil * 2) - ( ( \lceil \frac{x}{6}\rceil - 1 ) * 6) + (\lceil \frac{x}{6} \rceil * 2 )$ , *where x is your Fundamental value.*


## Attribute dice and Skills
For each of your fundamental value, you have three Attributes. _Memory/Knowledge_, _Wits_ and _Composure_ depending on the _Mind_, _Physic_, _Reaction Speed_ and _Pain Tolerance_ depending on the _Body_ and finally _Charisame_, _Insight / Manipulation_ and _Volition_ depending on the _Spirit_.
Each attribute is associated with a dice type. 

You also have access to 18 skills.

You can spend points to increase the die of an attribute or buy rank in a skill.
You may spend **50 points** at level 1. 

Increasing an attribute die by one category (d4 -> d6) costs **5 points**. 
Increasing a skill from (**n-1**) to **n** costs **n points**. Increasing a skill from **0** to **n** costs **((n-1) * n) / 2**.
