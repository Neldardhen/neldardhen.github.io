# Combat and Injuries
Combat rules for  [[Neldardhen System/Neldar System\|Neldar System]].
## Combat
Combat start when a PC or an NPC does any action that the other party considers to be hostile. There are no surprised round, instead at any point during combat, a target can be _unaware_ of its attacker. Every time a defendant is _unaware_ of an attack, the difficulty of the check to Dodge / Deflect or Resist it is doubled.

A target may be _unaware_ of an attacker if it doesn't physically perceive it or if it doesn't think the attacker as potentially hostile.

### Initiative
Initiative is always rolled at the moment an aggressive action is declared and **before it is taken**. _Unaware_ targets might not take actions and simply skip their turn if they roll a better initiative than the instigator of the attack.

Initiative is usually rolled with the Reaction Speed die. However, in specific situations an other attribute die can be used. For example, a duel between wizards might call for an initative roll with the Wits die. 
The number of dice used is equal to the Fighting skill rank (minimum of 1). Once again, specific situations might use an other skills (with always a minumum of 1 die). A rogue trying to stay hidden might be able to use their Stealth skill instead.

>Initiative = Fighting **d** Reaction Speed

Sometimes it is also possible to roll Initiative with one of the Senses/Perception Pool. In the case of an ambush, the ambusehd partx might used one of their Senses as their Initiative Pool.

### Combat Turn 
Combatants take their turn in order of initiative. On their turn a combatant can take **2 Actions**.

An **Action** is :
- Move (up to one's speed)
	- Step
	- Charge
- Attack
	- Grapple (No damage, but reduces any speed to 0. - needs a free hand)
	- Shove (No damage but push the target 2m away - needs a free hand or shield)
	- Throw (A character can throw a light weapon up to 2* their physics die in meters)
	- Take Aim (Next ranged attack action will gain a free die of 1 category less)
	- Reload (Some weapons, like crossbows, need to be reloaded with 1 Action)
- Attack with an Instrument
	-  Insult (Sort of unarmed Instrument Attack, see below)
- Healing with an Instrument
- Cast a spell (see [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Spells\|Spells]])
	- Remove 1 rune from a spell and add 1 rune to a spell.
- Use a special ability
- Ready an Action (Readying an Action allows to act out of turn, but takes **2 Actions**)

Out of their turn a combattant can :
- Attack of Opportunity (need a special Feat to unlock, or a weapon with a special trait)
- Defend 
	-  Dodge an attack, spell. or ability (avoid all damage)
	- Resist an attack, spell or ability. (Half damage, avoid Condition)

**Attack**
An attack roll with a weapon works like a skill check on Fighting with Physics. It is not possible to make an attack with Reaction Speed or Pain Tolerance, except if a particular weapon allows it.
The total result of the attack roll will be used to set the difficulty for the defendant wether they want to Dodge or Resist the damage.
Once an attack is successful, the damage roll is defined by the weapon the attacker is wielding.

**Unarmed Attack** : An unarmed physical attack is done like any attack, except its always deals 1 Bludgeoning Damage, unless the character possess a Feat that specify otherwise. 

> [!wip] _Work In Progress_
> **Flanking** : When a line from the middle of two allied token pass through an ennemy token.
> When an ennemy is flanked it gets **-1d4** on any Dodge checks against melee attacks from one of the two allies.

> [!wip] _Work In Progress_
> **Attack of Opportunity** : Only characters or creatures with the [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Progression/Skill Feat#^150996\|Attack of Opportunity Feat]] can use Attacks of Opportunity.
> When an ennemy is moving (unless they disengage ?? / Move only 2m ???), trying to cast a spell, use an object or making a ranged attack, you can attack them out of turn. (Once per round ?? At will ??) 

**Instrument Attack or Healing**
An attack roll or healing with an Instrument is done using Perfomance on Charisma and _resilience_ is used to buy the dice.
When helaing the Difficulty is a set **12** that can be modified by the type or quality of the instrument.

**Insult** : An insult can be seen as a sort of unarmed Instrument Attack. It is roll with Performance on Charisma and deals a fixed 1 Anxiety Damage on the Spirit. (see [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Combat and Injuries#^173746\|Damage Types]]). As with all Instrument Attacks, an Insult cannot be dodge only resisted. For this special case, if the target successfully Resists the insult all damage is negated. 

**Dodging**
Dodging an attack, spell or ability by using dice from the appropriate Defense Pool (see below) will allow the combatant to completely negates all effects of the spell or the attack.

Dodge checks are always made on Wits, Reaction Speed or Insight / Manipulation and it is not possible to buy dice with an other resource.

_Dodging a Body attack is always rolled with Fighting on Reaction Speed and only endurence can be use to buy dice from the Body Defense Pool._

**Resisting**
Resisting a spell or an attack by using dice from the appropriate Defense Pool (see below) will allow the combattant to halve any incoming damage and avoid additional effects or conditions.

In usual circomstances the defendant can choose to Dodge/Deflect or Resist the effects of an incoming attack unless the attack precises otherwise. A spellcaster can choose if their spell can be Deflected only, Resisted only or let the target choose. (see. [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Spells#^bdc950\|Spells]])

_Resisting a Spirit attack is always rolled with Raw Magic on Volition and only resilience can by use to buy dice from the Spirit Defense Pool._

##### Critical Success on Attacks
When a character dodge / deflect or resisit an attack, if the total they rolled is strictly less than half of the Difficulty (the attacker's or caster's total roll), then it is considered to be a critical success for the attacker and all incoming damage are doubled. Double the damage before applying any Resistance or Vulnerability.

#### Defense Pools{ #8397bd}

Each character has three different Defense Pools, one for their Mind based on their **Arcane Magic** skill, one for Body based on their **Fighting** skill and one for their Spirit based on their **Raw Magic** skill.
The maximum of a Defense Pool is equal to the **skill rank + 1**. At the start of their turn a character's Defense Pools are reset to their respective maximums.

Whenever a character is attacked during a round, they can choose to buy dice from their appropriate Defense Pool to try to Dodge / Deflect or Resist the attack (or spell). Dice bought this way are removed from the Pool until the start of the character next turn.

The first die is always free as well as any die granted by an eventual armour. The free dice are never removed from the Dice Pool.

The armour value for the Mind is called Ward and the armour value for the Spirit is called Veil.

### Dual Wielding
When a character is dual wielding weapons this enables them to make two attacks per Action, one with each weapons. However, the two attacks share the same dice pool based on the Fighting skill. Each attacks benefits from the free die and any speciality die any other die must be bought from the attack pool.

The attack pool is reset after each Action taken.

### Damage Type{ #173746}

Each damage type affects one part of the _Being_ except for _poison_ who can affect all three.

| **Mind (reduces focus)** | **Body (reduces endurance)** | **Spirit (reduces resilience)** |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Confusion                | Piercing / Slashing          | Fear                            |
| Oblivion                 | Bludgeoning / Force          | Charm                           |
| Psychic                  | Fire / Heat / Lightning      | Despair                         |
|                          | Cold / Freezing              | Anxiety                         |
|                          | Acid                         |                                 |
| Poison                   | Poison                       | Poison                          |

### Resitances, Vulnerabilities and Immunities{ #abbeee}

Resistances, Vulnerabilities and Immunities are always linked to a damage type and usually granted by one's species or special feats.
Resistances and Vulnerabilites comes with a value, generally a dynamic one like "Half your Body score" or "Equal to your level".  When applying resistances and vulnerability the value is removed from the total damage (in the casse of resistances) or added to it (in the case of vulnerabilities) before the damage is applied to the character.
Immunities reduce any damage of that type to 0.

> Ayrina is a [[Neldardhen World/Species/SubSpecies/Peat Goblins-Orcs\|Peat Orc]] an [[Neldardhen World/Species/Orcs\|Orc]] Subspecies. . She gets a Bludgeoning Resistance equal to Half of her Body score thanks to her Species, but suffers from a Vulnerability to Fire equal to Half of her level rounded down (min 1).
> She has a Body score of **8** and a level of **4**.
> She is attacks by someone using a Flamming Mace and failed her Dodge.
> Her opponent rolls the damage and get a result of **5** Bludgeoning + **2** Fire.
> Her Resistance to Bludgeoning has a value of (8/2 = 4), so she will only take **5 - 4** = **1** Bludgeoning damage.
> On the other hand, her Vulnerability to Fire has a value of (4/2 = 2) so she will take **2 + 2** = **4** Fire damage.
## Injuries{ #5a0385}

Every times someone does a task without the necessary resources to pay the cost of said task their _Fatigue_, _Exhaustion_ or _Stress_ level increases by **1**, depending on the part of their _Being_ the skill is associated with.  
It is also the case if a creature takes damage on a resource (_focus_, _endurance_ or _resilience_) which is already at 0.
_Work In Progress : unsure_  When a resource is at 0, only 1 additional die can be bought by incrementing the *Fatigue*, *Exhaustion* or *Stress* counter by 1.
Free dice never increase those counters.

If the damage received are greater than **9** then the _Fatigue_, _Exhaustion_ or _Stress_ level increments by **2**, similarly if the cost or damage is greater than **19** then the level increment by **3**, and so on and so forth.

Every time the _Fatigue_, _Exhaustion_ or _Stress_ level of a creature increments it must roll on the corresponding Injury table.

### Injuries Rolltables
A roll for an Injury is done in two steps. The first step will define if the Injury will be Temporary or Permanent. It is done by roll **1d6** and adding the corresponding *Fatigue*, *Exhaustion* or *Stress* level.
A result of **7** or lower gives a Temporary Injury, any result strictly higher than **7** means that the Injury will be Permanent.

>Ayrina has a *Fatigue* level of **2** and **0** point of *focus* left. She takes **14** Oblivion damage on her Mind incrementing her *Fatigue* level by an additional **2** (14 is greater than 9 so the level increases by 2).
>She now has to roll **1d6 + 4**, she rolled a 5 for a total of 5 + 4 = **9**.
>**9** being strictly greater than **7**, she will suffer from a Permanent Mind Injury !

### Temporary Injuries
Temporary injuries either heal with time or are easily healed with a commonly available treatment. They impart some handicaps  on the creature until they are healed.

### Permanent Injuries
Permanent injuries are either very hard to heal or cannot be healed at all. Their handicaps  are permanent and the creature must learn to live with them the best they can.

**Advices for Game Masters - Storytellers** : If a character suffer from an Injury due to damage, you can tell them to roll on the rolltable, but you are not forced to use the result as the Injury as is. Don't hesitate to modify or create new Injuries linked to the type or damage or situation the characters find themselves in.
A paralytic poison will probably have different lasting effects than a burn or a broken bone.

> [!gm] Note on Creatures
To simplify combat, creature controlled by the game masters don't get injuries. They will instead die as soon as either their _focus, endurance_ or _resilience_ reach 0. 
When a creature drops to 0 in a resource due to something else than damage (while attacking or defending) the creature doesn't die immediately, but enters a weaken state where they can not use abilities that cost them more than 1 of this resource.
## Death
At any moment, if the _Fatigue_, _Exhaustion_ or _Stress_ level of a character goes above **6** the character dies.

Death is permanent, resurrection magic doesn't exist in this world.
