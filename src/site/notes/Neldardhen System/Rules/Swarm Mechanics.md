# Swarm Mechanics

Some monsters or creature can form Swarms.

Swarm are composed of individuals with base stats that are added together.
_ie a Swarm of [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Creatures (Endëa)/Kuîjen\|Kuîjens]] is compose of individuals with Mind 2, Body 1, Spirit 1, therefore a swarm of 12 individuals has Mind 12, Body 6 and Spirit 6_ for a result of 48 focus, 18 endurance and 18 resilience.

Everytime enough damage is done to the swarm to kill 1 individual it looses the corresponding stats. 
_Dealing 3 endurance damage to a Swarm of Kuîjens also reduces its focus by 6 and its resilience by 3._

However, the damage is done if and only if an individual is killed !
_If an attack deals 10 endurance damage, then it's enough to kill 3 Kuîjens from the Swarm. Its stat will be reduce by 18 focus, 9 endurance and 9 resilience. In this case, 1 point of endurance damage is "lost", because 1 individual was "overkilled"._

Additionnally, a Swarm can have a Swarm Stage level. This level is used in its stat sheet to either increased some of its stats or damage or give it new abilities.
Swarm Stage are defined on top of the stats sheet listing the minimum number of individuals needed to reach each Stage.
_A Sawarm of Kuîjens reach Swarm Stage 2 at 5 individuals. Its Bitte attack changes from a 2d4 to a 3d4 and it deals an additional 1d2 of Piercing damage. It also gains access to the Psychic Spike attack._
