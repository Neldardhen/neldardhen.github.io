# Rest, Resourcing Activities and Downtime
Rules for recovery in the [[Neldardhen System/Neldar System\|Neldar System]].

## Rest and Needs
{ #d14e53}


The main way to recover _focus_ ![focus.png|15](/img/user/Images/focus.png), _endurance_ ![endurance.png|15](/img/user/Images/endurance.png) and _resilience_ ![resilience.png|15](/img/user/Images/resilience.png) is by _Resting_.

A _Rest_ includes eating food for the day and sleeping. Once a _Rest_ is done everyone check their needs and whether or not they have fulfilled them. Each need is linked to one part of the _Being_ and will dictate which recovery die will be rolled. If a need is unmet, the recovery die for the specific resource will be one category lower (a **1d6** would become a **1d4**).

The result of the recovery die is added to the current value of the resource.

| **Need**           | **Part of the Being** | **Resource** |            |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Sunlight           | Mind                  | Focus        | Fatigue    |
| Food and water     | Body                  | Endurance    | Exhaustion |
| Sleep and/or Dream | Spirit                | Resilience   | Stress     |

After each rest, the values of _fatigue_, _exhaustion_ and _stress_ level are **divided by 2** (rounded down.)
For each need that was not fulfiled, the _fatigue_, _exhaustion_ or _stress_ value is only decremented by **1**.

> Ayrina has a Mind score of 3, Body score of 5 and a Spirit score of 4. Her recovery dice are 2d6, 2d8 and 2d6 respectively.
> She had spent the day exploring dark caves and passages, thus her need for sunlight was not met, but she had plenty to eat and was able to sleep.
> This means that she will roll her full dice for her _endurance_ ![endurance.png|15](/img/user/Images/endurance.png) (Body) and _resilience_ ![resilience.png|15](/img/user/Images/resilience.png) (Spirit) :  **2d8** and **2d6**, but for her _focus_ ![focus.png|15](/img/user/Images/focus.png) (Mind) she will only be able to roll **2d4** (1 category of die less than her recovery dice of 2d6).
> 
> At the end of the day she had : **5** *focus* ![focus.png|15](/img/user/Images/focus.png), **4** *endurance* ![endurance.png|15](/img/user/Images/endurance.png) and **6** *resilience* ![resilience.png|15](/img/user/Images/resilience.png). In the morning she will roll her recovery dice and regain :
> 	 Mind : **2d4**, she gets a total of **3** her new value of _focus_ for the day is 8. 
> 	 Body : **2d8**, she gets a total of **9** her new value of _endurance_ for the day is 13. 
> 	 Spirit : **2d6**, she gets a total of **7** her new value of _resilience_ for the day is 12. (She cannot go over her resilience maximum which is 3 times her Spirit socre : **12**) 
> 

## Resourcing Activities
Some activities can replenish one resource for some cost. The cost can be other resources, time or simply money. Each resourcing activity is personal to each character, their cost and benefit may vary from character to character.

One character might be greatly helped focusing by drinking coffee, but not really tolerate the acidity of the beverage thus gaining a **+1d4** _focus_ ![focus.png|15](/img/user/Images/focus.png) and a **-2** _endurance_ ![endurance.png|15](/img/user/Images/endurance.png) when drinking a cup.

An other one might tolerate the acidity well but becoming a little bit agitated gaining a **+1**d4 to *focus* ![focus.png|15](/img/user/Images/focus.png) and a **-2** to *resilience* ![resilience.png|15](/img/user/Images/resilience.png).

A nice walk in nature might gives you a **+1d4** to _resilience_ ![resilience.png|15](/img/user/Images/resilience.png) and a **+2** to _focus_ ![focus.png|15](/img/user/Images/focus.png) while costing you only **2** _endurance_ ![endurance.png|15](/img/user/Images/endurance.png), but to complete this activity you need at least 1 hour and access to nature or a park.

>[!gm] Advice for GMs
 >As the adventure progress it is advised to emphasis to your players the discovery or creation of new Resourcing Activities for their characters. Activities that help them with their Permanent Injuries and tie into their character's narrative arc.
 >The idea of this game is to keep going, healing what can be healed and learning to manage what cannot.

#### Rule of thumb for creating Resourcing Activities

>[!wip] Work in Progress
This is still a work in progress, the specifics values might change

<table>
<tr><th>Costs </th><th>Benefits </th></tr>
<tr><td>-2 resource </td><td> +1d4 resource </td></tr>
<tr><td> 30 min + condition (ie. access to water) </td><td> + 2 resources </td></tr>
<tr><td> 1h + conditions</td><td>+2 reousrce1, +2 resource2 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 5 Seeds</td><td> +1d4 resources </td></tr>
<tr><td> 10 Seeds </td><td> +1d4 resource1, +1d4 resource2 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 15 Seeds</td><td> +2d4 resource </td></tr>
</table>

## Downtime
There are 3 main downtime activities:
- Train a skill
- Study a language
- Work for money

### Training
Training a skill allows to gain a free skill point after a period of intense dedicated training.
The numbers of days depend on the next skill rank.

| **form-to** (skill rank) | **number of day** | **time** (iris calendar*) |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| 0-1                      | 7                 | 1 week                    |
| 1-2                      | 28                | 1 month                   |
| 2-3                      | 112               | 4 months                  |
| 3-4                      | 449               | 1 year and 3 months       |
| 4-5                      | 1825              | 5 years                   |
\* In the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Cultures/Calendars/Iris Calendar\|Iris Calendar]], 1 month = 28 day and there is 13 months + 1 day in a year

### Study
The number of day of dedicated study to learn a new language depends on its difficulty relative to the languages you already now.

If the new language you want to learn is in the same language tree as a language you already now, then this language is considered to be an easy one for you, otherwise it's a hard language.
(See. [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Languages/Languages#^b6cf64\|Language Tree]])

| **Language difficulty** | **number of day** | **time** (iris calendar*) |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| Easy                    | 98                | 3 months and 2 weeks      |
| Hard                    | 301               | 10 months and 3 weeks     |

### Working
Once you have decided on the job that you will be performing during the downtime period, select with your Storyteller the skill and attrivbute that would apply.
The Story teller will then give you an expected average amount and a difficulty.

Roll for each day of downtime (or week or month, if downtime is very long) and count your accumulated success.

The formula belove will give you the amount of money you managed to make during downtime.

> *Formula* : $Money = Expected Amount + (\lfloor \frac{Successes}{Nb-Days} - 50\rfloor * Expectd Amount)$

 \*If you use the Neldar Character Sheet, the calculation is done automagically, so don't sweat it!
