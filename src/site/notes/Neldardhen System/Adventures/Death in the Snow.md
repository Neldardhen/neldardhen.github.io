Daetor noble of one of the Southern estate and ex-officer in the Nelataren army is looking to flee Nelatar. Not wanting to risk going through Egerot controlled territory, he decided for an itinerary through the mountains. He engaged a guide : Arlas, and a small group of adventurers to protect him, his wife Fidala and his steward Dagan during the dangerous journey.  
Others hopeless individuals join your group during the beginning of your travel, Ekanro a Priest-Healer of Ordel and his apprentice Sila and a Masked woman named Nerena.  
You began your journey shortly after the beginning of summer, but soon after you reached the mountains the weather turned for the worst. A blizzard is raging and you are now stuck in a refuge waiting for the sky to clear. Each night you barely make out the notes of a melancholic song covered by the screaming winds. Hint of a beautiful but eerie melody that fills you with sadness. As the dawn of the third day comes, you are waken up by a cry of anguish.
