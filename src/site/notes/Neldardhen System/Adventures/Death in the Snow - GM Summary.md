# GM Summary
Gm only summary for the [[Neldardhen System/Adventures/Adventures\|adventure]] [[Neldardhen System/Adventures/Death in the Snow\|Death in the Snow]].

The PCs and the travellers are stuck inside a moutain refuge due to some bad weather forbidding travel. In the morning of their 4th day here, they will be awaken by the cries of **Fidala Avari**, who found her husband (**Daetor Avaro**) dead outside.  

A little before the adventure's start, **Sila** met three hags disguised as old ladies. The hags pretended to need help and rewarded **Sila** with a magic iron-like ring that would allow **Sila** to communicate with directely with one the hags, **Moelle** ([Annis Hag](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#annis%20hag_mpmm)). The ring is an Iron Token (see Iron Token under the Info section of the [Annis Hag](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#annis%20hag_mpmm))

**Moelle** has been talking to Sila through the ring, acting as a kind and empathetic grandmother, but in actuallity, slowly corrupting her.

**Moelle** [Annis Hag](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#annis%20hag_mpmm) is part of a coven with two other hags **Miasme** [Green Hag](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#green%20hag_mm) and **Engelure** [Bheur Hag](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#bheur%20hag_mpmm).
**Engelure** has been casting [Control Weather](https://2014.5e.tools/spells.html#control%20weather_phb) every day in the morning for 3 days (or more, if you wish the PCs to have been stuck inside for longer) in order to make travel impossible.

# The Night of the Murder
**Sila**, pushed by the whispers of **Moelle** is the one who murdered **Daetor**.
**Daetor** was dismissive and treating her like she did not even exist and **Sila** slowly grow resentful.

Shortly after the unatural blizzard stranded the group inside, **Daetor** caught a nasty cold, fearing that it could take a turn for the worst, **Erkano** was preparing some herbal medicine for **Daetor** to take, Sila **was** often the one to bring it to him in the evening.

In the evening, **Sila** added some monkshood ([Aconitum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aconitum) ) to **Daetor**'s potion. 

**Symptoms**
- nausea
- vomitting
- diarrhea
- sweating
- dizziness
- difficulty in breathing
- headache 
- confusion

**Daetor**, due to those symtoms, woke up **Fidala** in the middle of the night. He had diffculty breathing and said he had a headache and  needed some fresh air. He stumbled with difficulty down the stairs, which woke up **Quicksilver**.
**Sila**, waiting for her moment, was waiting for him and followed **Daetor** outside and tried to stab him with a knife from the kitchen while he was in a weaken state, she left the knife in the wound and quickly went back to her and **Erkanro**'s room.
Leaving the knife in the wound, is what allowed **Sila** to flee without having any blood on her. The wound still bled after, meaning that Daetor was still alive when stabbed.

**Post Mortem**
- Signs of diarrhea
- Knife wound in the back, with the knife stuck in it, did not do any lethal damage.
- Blood from the wound still soaked his clothes ; he was alive when stabbed
- Nothing was heard from inside the refuge ; he did not call for help or at least not with enough strength to wake up the people inside.
- Cyanosis (Due asphyxia and frostbite) His finger tips, toes and lips are blue.
- The cause of death was paralysis of the hearth and respiratory center causing asphyxia (Can only be confirmed via a Wish spell or a Divin Intervention)

Both Daetor and Nerena are in possession of monkshood, both possess various plants that can be used in herbal medicine or in poisoning (rulewise Daetor has a Herbalism Toolkit and Nerena a Poisoner Toolkit) to reconise that Nerena has specifically a poisoner toolkit and not an herbalism one, a character must either be part of the Masked Ones or be a Rogue and succeed a **DC 15** Survival or Nature check.

## Daetor was poison before being stabbed and the poison was the cause of death
- He complained to his wife that the potion was bitter this time (Fidala)
- The knife wound was not lethal (DC 15 Medicine check or DC 20 Survival check, fighters or rogues have a DC of 5 less than other characters)
- He had difficulty breathing when he woke up in the middle of the night and complain of a headache and needing fresh air (Fidala)
- Quicksilver saw him struggling to get down the stairs and acting confused (Quicksilver, need Speak with animals)

## Sila is the poisoner
- She was the one bringing the potion to Daetor
- The knife stab was done be someone with low strength and smaller than Daetor (DC 25 Survival check, rogue have a DC of 5 less)
- Quicksilver saw her following Daetor outside (Speak with animals and a DC 25 Persuasion or Deception check) Quicksilver with admit seeing someone following Daetor outside, but will try to protect Sila. He doesn't believe that she has the strength to kill Daetor and wants to protect her as he sees her as a "kitten".
- Sila herself seems worried and can be seen "talking to herself" while fiddlelling with her iron ring. (she is actually talking to Moelle through the Iron Token)

## Hags are involved
- The weather is unatural (DC 10 Nature or Survival check, automatic success for druids or rangers)
- Sila's ring is magical (Detect Magic or DC 15 Arcana check, only magic users can make this check)
- Sila's ring is not made of iron and will _not_ repel Fey creatures. (She says and believes that her ring is made of iron and is a lucky charm to protect her against evil fey... hags do love irony)
- Speaking with the Banshee near the well (see below) will reveal that hags are living in the vicinity.
- If interogated about her iron ring Sila will mention meeting three old women in the wilderness. Anyone from Nelatar or Egerot knows this saying :
> [!gm] Three Old Women
>"One old woman in the wood : A healer gathering herbs to heal you.
>Two old women in the wood : A couples of gossipers talking about you.
>Three old women in the wood : No women but hags that will gleefuly hurt you."

## The Well
Every night, the PCs can hear beautiful but sorrowful singing from the well. This song is coming from **Nimwen** a [Banshee](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#banshee_mm) that was tricked by the same group of hag a long time ago. If the PCs talk to her and at decently polite they can learn the story of her death and therefore learn about the hags.

> [!gm] Nimwen's Story
> Young and beautiful elf lost in the mountains and slowly dying of exposure.  
> She was found by three hags,. The hags, cackling, asked her what she would give to not die young.
> "Anything !", she answered.
> "So you would rather die old and decrepit like we are ?"
> "Yes, yes I rather die old and decrepit ! Please help me !"  
> The hags then stole away her youthfulness and her beauty and left her to die in the snow.

## NPCs' secrets
Those secrets can be uncovered while the PCs interrogate the travellers, don't hesitate to give to your PCs some secrets of their own !

### Daetor Avaro
Full of himself, he loves power and being in control.

He was declared a Coward by the Princ of Nelatar. He awaits imprisonnement in Nelataren and judgement by the Prince. He may face execution.

### Fidal Avari
She lived a sheltered life and doesn't understand the struggles of people who are not of noble birth, but she is open to learn and has a kind hearth.

She is horrified at the death of her husband even if she did not love him.

She has an affair with **Dagan**.

### Dagan
They have served Daetor and his family for most of their life. Daetor used to make fun of them and their "feminine ways". They stayed in his service despite thw humiliations, because they have beeen havinf an affair with **Fidala**.

### Nerena 
She is not a human, but an [[Neldardhen World/Species/Essedir\|Esseret]] (Yuan-ti). She is a member of the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Cultures/Masked Ones\|Masked Ones]] and a worshiper of the [[DnD Specific/Otherworldly Patrons/Daor, the Black Snake\|Black Snake]].
She wants to end the corrupt "reign" of the [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Places/Nelatar#^b8e726\|Temple of Ordel]]. She had orders to kill **Ekanro the Laft Hand**, but she decided to hold her hand when she learnt that he has been excommunicated.
Her reasoning being that she was ordered to kill "Ekanro the Left Hand" not "Ekanro the Wandering Priest".

### Ekanro
Former Left Hand og the High Priest of Ordel, he was excommunicated by the Temple.
He wants to go back to the roots of the priest-healers and help the common people.
He still hold some prejudices against the Masked Ones, but is starting to recognised that they are helping the common people more than the current priests of the Temple.

### Sila
Orphan from the street of Ordelen, she was taken in by the Temple and treated as a slave.
Realising the horrible condition the orphans were living in, **Ekanro** took her as an apprentice.
Ekanro is the only person who show her kindness so far and the only one she trusts. 
When she became apprentice priest-healer, she was given a nice light blue cloak (as the custom wants it), but the Temple refused to replace her rags with better clothes. Furious, Ekanro spoke out during the ceremony and this is the inciting incident that lead to his excommunication and Sila and him adopting a humble nomadic lifestyle as itinerant healers.
(Sila still doesn't have better clothes, because Ekanro had to pay the Temple heavy fine for even being allowed to leave...)
Since helping the three old ladies in the wood, Sila has been talking to her iron ring seeing in Moelle the mother figure that she lacks.

### Arlas and Quicksilver
They are the travellers guide. They know the region quite well, because they belive that there is a portal to the [[Neldardhen World/Nyalë/Nyalë\|Dusk World]] somewhere in the mountains. They are looking for it and have spend a significant amount of time axploring the mountains.
The have a snow leopard beast companion named Quicksilver.
