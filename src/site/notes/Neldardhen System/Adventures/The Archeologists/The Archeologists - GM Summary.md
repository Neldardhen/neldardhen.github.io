# GM Summary : The Archeologists
Gm only summary for the [[Neldardhen System/Adventures/Adventures\|adventure]] [[Neldardhen System/Adventures/The Archeologists/The Archeologists\|The Archeologists]].


> [!warning] GM Only information !
> If you are a player please don't read any further !


> [!wip] _Work in Progress_
> This is still a work in progress, some sections are missing

The PCs are on (somewhat) of a timed clock as a rival group paid by a particular, Lord Barnnon a [[Neldardhen World/Species/Behemes\|Behemes]] (Giff), is already on site trying to excavate a direct path to the tomb. Digging through the rocky hills would take weeks or even month, but they have sent a messenger back to the city of Inrast to request enough black powder to make explosives. 

## Before the adventure start
Give to each of your players' character at least one magic item. You can give them one from this list : [[Neldardhen System/Adventures/The Archeologists/The Archeologists - Magic Items#^8ccebd\|Starting Items]] or give them some more personalised ones. You can even ask them to come up with a magic item of their own.
Ask them how they came in possession of their item and what they did with it. Let them sell it if they want and potentially buy something else with the money they made. (Give them around 1'000 and 2'000 gp for the item and let them buy any weapon +1 or leather armour / studded leather armour +1 or anything else of similar power).

### If the PCs are level 1
Just before arriving on the site they will encounter a [Gnoll hunter](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#gnoll_mm) and two [Hyenas](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#hyena_mm)
Let your PCs gain a level after the fight so they are level 2 for the rest of the adventure.

## Unsafe Rest
From this point in the adventure, if the group decide to take a Long Rest in an unguarded and unsafe place, roll 4d20 per night, if any of the roll is a 5 or less they are attacked by three [Giant Scorpions](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#giant%20scorpion_mm) \[Adaptation for level 2s : only 1 Giant Scorpion attacks the sleeping PCs\]

## Rival group encampment
An encampment of square and rectangular tents guarded by 3 visible [[Neldardhen World/Species/Behemes\|Behemes]] (Giffs) with black powder weapons.
Some [[Boscides\|Boscides]] (Loxodons) can be seen inside a tent, taking notes. Magically sensitive PCs will know that the [[Boscides\|Boscides]] are probably spellcasters.

The guards will intercept the PCs before they can get into the camp and tell them that this area is dangerous and that they need to leave.
If the PCs insist or mention the Society of Archeology, the guards will tell them that the Society has no power here and that they are here under the orders of Lord Barnnon.

Any PC who has spent a decent amout of time in Inrats, knows who Lord Barnnon is. A rich and moderetely influencal noble of the city, who has an interest in "ancient technologies and artefacts". He possess an impressive personal collection and is constantly at odds with the Society of Archeolgy. Members of the Society call him "the grave robber with clean hands" since he delegate all of the dirty work to mercenaries.

The PCs can try to snoop around during the night. If they are caught they are firmly ecorted aoutside of the camp after being searched for stolen document or black powder.
If the PCs are caught a second time, this will start a fight. If they win, the mercenaries will stripped them of all of their possessions, knock them out and leave them in the desert to die.

Notes and letters in the encampment reveal the following information :
- They are employed by Lord Brannon (Noble of the city of Inrast with a huge personal collection of dubiously aquired artefacts)
- They are paid very well compared to the PCs
- Progress on digging through the hills is slow 
- The sent a messenger the day before to request a huge quantity of black powder 

> [!gm] Grave robbing, but legally
> Let's be honest, the Society of Archeology has no moral high ground over Lord Barnnon, they are grave robbers in all but name. They do however have some legal ground (in Uruithel at least).
> That's why they asked the PCs for an inventory of the tomb as detailed as possible. If the group comes back with the official papers all fill up, then the Society can claim the tomb as property of the museum and contest any item in Lord Barnnon' possession that would match one of the descripiton given by the PCs in their inventory of the place.

See [[Neldardhen System/Adventures/The Archeologists/The Archeologists - NPCs#^111ebd\|NPCs - Rival Group]]

## Caerfaldir encampment
A camp with a circular agencement made of various sized hexagonal and octogonal tents.
The tribe of [[Neldardhen World/Species/Caerfaldir\|Caerfaldir]] (Leonins) goes hunting during dusk and just before dawn. The can be found resting during the hottest hours of the day. The will welcome travellers and share shade and water.

They are visibly uneasy, but welcome outsiders anyways. The PCs are invated to talk with the Chief of the tribe [[Neldardhen System/Adventures/The Archeologists/The Archeologists - NPCs#^0c7354\|Inaa]].

They are particulariy amicable which is unusual (**DC 15** Insight check suggest that they might need something from the PCs)

They know about the tomb and they alos know of a secret passage to get to it. They are not particulary enchanted at the idea of strangers pillaging their ancestors place of rest, but they are also pragmatic and they are ready to tell the PCs where the entrance to the secret passage lies if the PCs retrieve for them a particular spear.

The tribe is quite deseparate for the spear. They will try their best to not show it (**DC 15** Insight check, shows their desesparation). They are still prideful though and if ask about the ritual or why they are so desesparate they will simply answer "Caerfal problems are for Caerfaldir to solve." and refuse to talk about the subject any further.

See  [[Neldardhen System/Adventures/The Archeologists/The Archeologists - NPCs#^08d488\|Tribe's Members]]

What they know about :
**The Oasis**
- There is an Oasis nearby
- public Oasis, anyone can drink their fill and take as much as 2 waterskin of water per day to do as they please with it, but no more.
- There is creature who claim the oasis as her own recently, she seems angry at something but has not beeen agressive towards the tribe. It seems wise not to anger her further, she seems powerful.

**Cikryu**
- They react with fear to the name, but try to hide it.
- The will answer with a bland "Caerfal problems are for Caerfaldir to solve" if pushed, they won't elaborate any further.
- A **DC 20** *Persuasion* check (**DC 25** if talking to the chief **Inaa** or the star-reader **Ehor**. **Ugnela** "the one-who-counts" cannot be convinced to talk in any circumstances), will convinced them to elaborate :
	- It seems to be a creature out of this world
	- It has beeen tormoenting the tribes for a while now, it has not kill anybody yet, because it "enjoy seeing your fear grow and your tribe slowly fall apart."
	- Hunter were sent to kill it, none were successful
	- The star-readers and the "one-who-counts" (see. [[Neldardhen System/Adventures/The Archeologists/The Archeologists - NPCs#^08d488\|Trube's members]]) think that there is a way to sent it back to were it truely belongs.
	- **Inaa** or **Ehor** knows a bit more :
		- They will whisper the word "devil", but only once.
		- They tell that they think that particular spear was once belonging to an ancestor of the tribe and that it's their best shot at banishing the creature out of this world.

**The Tomb**
- They know of a cave entrance further away which leads to the tomb.
- Most of the tribe are not very happy about strangers robbing the tombs of their ancestors, but they are also very pragmatic and they really need the help of the PCs to acquire the spear.

**The Spear** ([[Neldardhen System/Adventures/The Archeologists/The Archeologists - Magic Items#^bf30ff\|Ahiir's Spear]])
- It is magical, but otherwise looks exactely like any other soldier spear of the time. Made in wood with a bronze head and the name of the wielder inscribed in the handle.
- The name inscribed into it is : Ahiir
- The tribe need it for an important ritual.

## Cikryu, the Rakshasa

When the PCs leave the tribe a [Rakshasa](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#rakshasa_mm) will accost them. Don't say he is a Rakshasa, but describe him in the same way you would describe the [[Neldardhen World/Species/Caerfaldir\|Caerfaldir]] (Leonin), but with tiger's features instead of lion's. He is smoking a pipe and relexed like if he was sitting in a noble's parlour in Inrast rather than in the middle of the desert.
**DC 10** Perception check let the PCs notice that he has inverted hands
**DC 20** History or Religion check let the PCs know that he is a Devil. (They will also know that Devils being Lawful Evil, generaly keep their words and only tell truth. It doesn't mean that they won't try to manipulate or deceive)

The Rakshasa will present himself as Cikryu and says that he overheard the PCs conversation with the tribe.
He offers an alternative. He also knows where the secret entrance is and propose to reveal it to the PCs if the latter bring him back a vial of pure water and a pouch of pure sand from the oasis nearby.
(Spellcasters who succeed a **DC 20** check on their spellcasting ability can intuit that those ingredient could be use for the summoning of an elemental).

When asked why he doesn't do it himself, he answer that a "particular someone" has taken residence at the oasis and he would rather not talk to her at the moment. "Things are... complicated", he clearly makes it sounds like a bad break-up while never explicitely telling so.
He will use such sentences as "She can be intense" or "I wanted to distance myself for a while".

During his dialog Cikryu will often use the terms "contract" or "deal" and will be adamant that he do not say lies (the word "say" is important there. He will still lie by omission or try to decieve) and upholds his promises.
Character that notice that can retry a **DC 15** History or Religion check to gather that he is a Devil.
## The Museum (Tribe's route)
If the party decide to help the tribe and bring back the spear, they will have to travel back to Inrast.

Once back at the Museum, let them come with whatever idea or plan they want. Almost anything can work. Including :
- Persuading, Decieving or Intimidating the clerc in charge of the inventory.
	- Adapt the DC depending on the credibility of the scenario.
	- They could pretend to be student needing a spear fo their research (**DC 15** Persuasion/Deception)
	- They could simply Intimidate without other explanations (**DC 15** Intimidation to get access to the spears, **DC 20** Intimidation to ensure that the clerc will stay silent afterward)
- They can bribe the clerc (the clerc will be more easily convinced by magical item or interesting unusual items rather than just money, if your PCs are really desesparate for ideas, money can work too.)
- They can try to infiltrate the Museum at night (**DC 15** Stealth)

However they gained access to it, the PCs find themselves in a store room, where countless artefacts of lower value are kept. There is a rack with multiple similar looking spears.
The spear are in various state of decay but seem otherwise almost identical.

Each is made from a wooden shaft with a bronze point. Each spear has a small inscription carved into it. The inscripiton is written in Ancient Laugsuil. PCs who have studied that languages can automatically know that the inscripiton are names.

### How to find Ahiir's spear
[[Neldardhen System/Adventures/The Archeologists/The Archeologists - Magic Items#^bf30ff\|Ahiir's Spear]] can be recognized by the PCs through different means :
- The spear emit an aura of ancient magic (Detect Magic spell or a **DC 15** Arcana check, **DC 20** Religion check might also work)
- The spear is the one who is the most well preserved of the bunch.
- The spear has the inscription "Aghiir" written in Ancient Laugsuil. (A PCs who has studied Ancient Laugsuil can spot this right away, otherwise the clerc knows the basics of the language and can give them a transcription of the names on the spears.) 

Once the the PCs bring back the spear to the tribe [[Neldardhen System/Adventures/The Archeologists/The Archeologists - NPCs#^aadf55\|Ehor]] and [[Neldardhen System/Adventures/The Archeologists/The Archeologists - NPCs#^2b586c\|Ugnela]] will verify its authenticity and in the case the PCs brought back the correct spear [[Neldardhen System/Adventures/The Archeologists/The Archeologists - NPCs#^49f95a\|Eniir]] will be ordered to lead them to the secret passage.

## The Oasis (Cikryu's route)
If the party decide to take Cikryu's offer, the will quickly find the oasis and a [Lamia](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#lamia_mm) who has taken residence here.
She is still young for a Lamia and dream of making herself a lair with slaves at her service. 
When the PCs arrive, she is using the oasis as a scrying surface to locate Cikryu. 
Rakshasa being immune to spell of 6th level or lower and the Scrying spell of the Lamia innate casting being considared a 5th level one, it is obviously not working.
She can be heard saying with anger "Where is he ? Where is he ? How can he keep hidding from me ?"

> [!gm] Cikryu and the Lamia
> The Lamia is young and easily impressed by power, she has fallen for the charms of Cikryu and came to the oasis on his advice.
> She is now angry at Cikryu because he as explicitely forbidden her to harm the Caerfal Tribe (only members of this specific tribe) and he is refusing to see her.
> He is using her to further torment the Caerfal tribe, but doesn't want them to die or be enslave as he want to keep tormenting them and only kill them once he would have grown bored of them. (Which given he is a devil couls take quite some time...)
> 
> If the Lamia is killed the only comment from Cikryu will be "Oh, what a shame! She had potential", but he doesn't seem sad nor angry.

If she sees the PCs, already angry and not at all in a mood to talk, she will exclaim : "You will make decent slaves for now ! " and attack.

> [!gm] Adaptation for level 2
> The Lamia has 70 HP and an AC of 12
> Multiattack : 1 attack with her dagger and 1 claw attack or she uses her intoxicating touch.
> Dagger : to hit : +3, 1d4 + 2 piercing
> Claws : to hit : +3, 2d4 + 2 slashing
> Intoxicatin Touch : to hit : +3, Charisma save DC 12 
> 	on a fail : taget is cursed for 1 hour, disadvantage on Wisdom save and ability checks
> **Spellcasting** : Spellsave DC 13

She is also a coward and as soon as the combat cleary turns badly for her (either she lose more than 3/4 of her HP or she takes an absurd amount of damage in one turn), she will surrender begging for her life.
She might try to cast some sneaky Suggestion or Charm Person spell whie the PCs are talking to her.
She will talk a lot but not be overtly useful. The Pcs can gather the following informaion :
- She is looking to establish a lair and wants to have slave of her own.
- Cikryu is the one who encourage her to come to this oasis, but he forbid her to hurt or enslave the member of the Caerfal tribe nearby. She resent him for it. Feeling that it is a right to enslave them.
- She will sometime refers to Cikryu as "handsome devil !", hard to say if it is just a turn of phrase or if she knows that Cikryu is indeed a devil. (If your PCs already know that Cikryu is a devil or strongly suspect it, the Lamia can be ignorant about that fact. If your PCs have no idea that Cikryu is a Devil then the Lamia might know and be te one to reveal that fact to them.)
- She knows nothing about the tomb and doesn't care about it.

Once the PCs brings back the water and the sand to Cikryu, he will lead them to the secret passage. The secret passage is a roughly a 100 meters (~330 feet) away from his own encampment. 

If the PCs try to find the passage on their own, Cikryu is hidding it with a strong illusion. They have no chance to pierce through it.
## The Cave
As to PCs navigate the narrow passages of the cave, they are attacked by 3 [Kruthik](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#adult%20kruthik_mpmm).

> [!gm] Adaptation to level 2
> Each Kuhtrik as 20 HP and AC 16
> They loose the multi-attack ability
> Stap : to hit : +3, 1d6 + 1 piercing
> Spike : same range, to hit +3, 1d4 + 2 piercing

Once the Kruthik dispatched, they can access the tomb without further complication.
## The Tomb

TODO

2 [Mummies](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#mummy_mm)

> [!gm] Rhea and Ahor's tomb
## The Ritual (Tribe's route)

TODO

> [!gm] Cikryu and Ahiir
> ~ 5'000 years ago, Cikryu managed to manipuling the then Emperor of Laugsuil rendering him mad and pushing the Empire into a terrible civil war.
> 
> Ahiir, the Emperor's  own daughter joined the rebels and was armed as a simple soldier with a bronze spear. 
> She finally managed to kill Cikryu and send him back to the Nine Hells for thousand of years of torment while his body reforms
> 
> The Banishment speel requires an item distasteful to the target and no object is more hated by Cikryu than the spear that killed him.
 
## Consequences (Cikryu's route)

TODO

[Invisible Stalker](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#invisible%20stalker_mm)

## Back in Inrast
The PCs are paid the promised 100gp, if they completed a careful inventory of the tomb and did not steal anything from it (or were particulariy clever in the way they stole it and avoided waking up the Mummies and falsified the documents) they get an additional 100gp for a work well done.

If the PCs did a good enough job in the eyes of the Society, the latter will hire them again for the [[Neldardhen System/Adventures/The Giants Lost to Time/The Giants Lost to Time\|The Giants Lost to Time]] adventure. If they were showing some more ...loose morality, Lord Barnnon is the one to hire them instead.
