> [!sys] Advice
> Try to give to one of the character a way to see invisible creatures, its not necessary, but it might help some groups.
> The Gem of Seeing is the obvious choice, but spell like See Invisibility or Faerie Fire can also work.

Translate to "Aghiir" ([[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Languages/Ancient Laugsuil Language\|Ancient Laugsuil]]) or "Ahiir" in Lósúl.

It has an aura of ancient magic, no school in particular, maybe some similarities with Transmutation and Evocation magic, but it is its own thing.

It can be used in the Banishment ritual to send [[Neldardhen System/Adventures/The Archeologists/The Archeologists - NPCs\|Cikryu]] back to the Nine Hells.
