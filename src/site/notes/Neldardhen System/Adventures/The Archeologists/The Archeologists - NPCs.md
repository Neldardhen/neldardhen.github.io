![Ehor-token.png|70](/img/user/Images/NPCs/Ehor-token.png)**Star-reader** : Ehor
In addition of being an accomplished warrior, Ehor is also the star-reader of the tribe. He knows ancient secrets about the movement of the stars and can learn from them to decipher the future of the tribe.

![Eugni-token.png|70](/img/user/Images/NPCs/Eugni-token.png)**Star-reader's apprentice** : Eugni
Young Eugni is still naive, but eager to learn. Her mentor, Ehor, is teaching her both the secrets of the stars and the spear. She can be overly enthusastic at times and doesn't seem to even tire.

![Ugnela-token.png|70](/img/user/Images/NPCs/Ugnela-token.png)**The "One-Who-Counts"** : Ugnela
She is rarely seen speaking and her sharp eyes seem to always be calculating something. She is the "One-Who-Counts", the one that knows the secrets of numbers and how to reveal them. Believing that power comes from knowledge and strength, she is ready to stab Inaa in the back at the first sign of weakness.

![Rathom-token.png|70](/img/user/Images/NPCs/Rathom-token.png)**The "One-Who-Counts"'s aoorentice** : Rathom
He is Ugnela's apprentice and lover. While most of the tribe thinks that Ugnela is using him, Rathom seems quite happy with the relationship. He shares his lover's ideas about power enven if he might not agree with some of her more extreme takes.
