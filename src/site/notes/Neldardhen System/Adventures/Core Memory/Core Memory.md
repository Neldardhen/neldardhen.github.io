# Core Memory
[[Neldardhen System/Adventures/Adventures\|Adventure]], taking place in the city of [[Neldardhen World/Cosmologies/Termin\|Termin]]

## Hook
*You wake up on an embalming table, you have lost all but a few memories of who you are. All you know is that you don't belong here.*

Inspired by the settings of Planescape Torment : the city of Sigil, but with my own twist on it and adapted to the Neldardhen universe.
