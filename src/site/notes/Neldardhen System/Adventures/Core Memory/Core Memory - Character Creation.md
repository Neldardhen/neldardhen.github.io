# Core Memory - Character Creation
Those are the character creation rules for the [[Neldardhen System/Adventures/Core Memory/Core Memory\|Core Memory]] [[Neldardhen System/Adventures/Adventures\|adventure]].

**Rules** : [[Neldardhen System/Neldar System\|Neldar]]
**Starting level** : 1 
**Species** : Any [[Neldardhen System/Rules/Character Creation/Playable Species List\|Playable Species List]] 

NO Backstory, but you need to define 
- 4 memories 
- 1 core memory 
- 4 (or more) NPCs

**Memories**
Each memory can give you a constant little bonus and disadvantage or give you a big conditional bonus and disadvantage.
Some examples
*I saw a friend die in a fire*, *I will never will let that happen again* -> Gain resistance to fire damage, but suffer 1d4 Despair damage everytime an ally suffer from fire damage.
*I saw a friend die in a fire*, *Fire is terrifying* -> Suffer 1d4 Fear damage when in presence of a big or uncontrolled fire, but gain 2m of movement speed.
*Enjoying a late meal with my family on a summer evening*, *I always take the time to appreciate life* -> You gain 1 point in Spirit but loose 2m of movement speed.

Your core memory can be something very simple (*The day I adopted my cat. The first step on my adventuring journey. The day I met my spouse. The time I climb a tree for the first time*), but it will be the core of your character personality and a memory that I cannot just take away from your PC without your consent.

**NPCs**
People that were in your life at some point however longlasting. It can also be just someone you met in passing and never saw again. 
*That handsome orc boy buying flour that I never muster the courage to talk to.* 
*The old lady selling medicinal herbs that I bought when my sister got sick.*
Or someone important to you
*My uncle who raised me after my parent died.* *That prick in wizard school who destroyed my research papers !*

For all the stuff above you can be specific, but don't be afraid to leave some things vague. You just lost most of your memories, maybe you remember that you were doing research and that someone destroyed your notes, but you don't remember the subject at all.
