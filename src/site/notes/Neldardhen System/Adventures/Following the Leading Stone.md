# Following the Leading Stone
#Adventure/oneShot, #Adventure/survival
[[Neldardhen System/Adventures/Adventures\|Adventure]] through the Northen Polar Desert.

## Hook
Nina Kesta a scientist, wizard, researcher and explorer wants to find where the needle of black stone in the compass truely leads. She knows that it is not the same place as the Noth marked by the stars and she suspect that something of importance can be find there, otherwise why would have someone want to such lengths as to enchant those particular stones to point the way ?

She spent month preparing a spell calibrated to the place ; it will allow her to teleport back to the city of Alcarin from there, but first she must go there. 
The place in question lies somewhere on the barren ice sheets of the North.
She as engaged you (and will pay very handsomely) to be part of her expedition.
Pack your warm clothes !

### Journey plan
The group will travel through the Faelrim Forest until the edge of the taiga, there they will meet with Will of the Howling Wind, a Lynfal musher that will lend you his sleds and dogs for the travel in the tundry and beyond.
