# GM Summary : The Archeologists
Gm only summary for the [[Neldardhen System/Adventures/Adventures\|adventure]] [[Neldardhen System/Adventures/The Archeologists\|The Archeologists]].

The PCs are on (somewhat) of a timed clock as a rival group paid by a particular, Lord Barnnon a [[Neldardhen World/Species/Behemes\|Behemes]] (Giff), is already on site trying to excavate a direct path to the tomb. Digging through the rocky hills would take weeks or even month, but they have sent a messenger back to the city of Inrast to request enough black powder to make explosives. 

## Before the adventure start
Give to each of your player characters at least one of theses magic items. Ask them how they came in their possession and what they did with it. Let them sell it if they want and potentially buy something else with the money they made. (Give them around 1'000 and 2'000gp for the item).

### Gem of Seeing
Probably in possession of a scholary type of character (or a rogue who stole it from a scholary type of npc...) [Gem of Seeing](https://2014.5e.tools/items.html#gem%20of%20seeing_dmg)

### Dodecahedron of Protection and Stone of Good Luck
For a character coming from the desert of Laugsuil or one who had some relation to the desert tribes. The [Stone of Good Luck](https://2014.5e.tools/items.html#stone%20of%20good%20luck_dmg) takes the form of an obsidian fennec with rubies for eyes if it comes from Laugsuil. It can takes the standard form (cat with green agates for eyes if it comes from somewhere else.)

> [!sys] Advice
> Try to give to one of the character a way to see invisible creatures, its not necessary, but it might help some groups.
> The Gem of Seeing is the obvious choice, but spell like See Invisibility or Faerie Fire can also work.

### If the PCs are level 1
Just before arriving on the site they will encounter a Gnoll hunter and two hyenas
