## Hook
_In the year 1917 of the Flowering Age, a new island suddenly appeared in the middle of the Enedaeron ocean._ _Delegations and expeditions from Côfûl, Rhuk, Uruithel, Baramlug, Rancanad, Thandnûr and even Calendôr and Eretol._ _The treacherous waters and aquatic monsters around the island often meant that this was a one way trip. Sadly each government was convinced that the disappearances of their ships was due to the sabotage of their rivals and thus, they kept sending more and better equipped ships to the new island._ _Tales of gigantic monsters and cursed waters started to spread among the sailors and soon t became harder and harder to find volunteers agreeing to set sail for the island who was now known as "Húnatol" the Cursed Island._ _The high cost of those expeditions combined with the lack of positive results finally convinced the various governments to stop sending new ships to the island and on a tacit common accord the whole affair was quietly forgotten._ _This happened 15 years ago. You were part of one of those hapless expeditions that find themselves stranded on Húnatol._ _Since then, survivor from every origin have set aside their differences and banded together to make a life for themselves on the island or find a way to leave it._
