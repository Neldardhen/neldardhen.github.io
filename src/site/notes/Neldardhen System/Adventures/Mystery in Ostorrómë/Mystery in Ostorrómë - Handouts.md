Wax tablets are commonly used to take ephemeral notes. This set of tablets seems to be magically connected to an other set of similar tablets. It seems that whatever is written on one pair almost instantaneously appears on the other one. A conversation between two obviously different person can still be read on them.

**Note on Language**
On the Foundry VTT the text is written in [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Languages/Languages#^1ba3f1\|East Palanian]] except for the word _dumb water-head_ which id written in [[Neldardhen World/Endëa/Cultures_Nations/Languages/Languages#^1ba3f1\|Talanian]]. With the Polyglot Module installed, it allows for only the character knowing each languages to be able to read them.
### Conversation

	Don't you fear that your "interest" in the Earth Moon has become somewhat of an obsession ?  
  
	Because you don't feel like you are yourself _not_ obsess with those stupid gems ?  
  
	"Stupid gems" ? as a gnome, I would have though that you would be showing a bit more respect for my work !  
  
	aS A gNoME… Are you kidding me !? We are not all married to those stupid rocks ! Now did you actually wanted something from me or are you just loosing my time ?  
  
	Yes, are you the one who told Vobarus to used _bones_ in his rituals ? He started killing small animals and I fear he will soon bring unwanted attention to himself.  
  
	I might have, but you can't denied that he is showing promising result since then ! Just tell him to be more discrete.  
  
	Correlation does not necessarily means causation !  
	You dumb water-head, he is improving because he is quickly learning what I'm teaching him, nothing to do with you or your antiquated methods.

	Oh please, spare me your Talanian ! Now if you'll excuse me I have work to do.

Those pages are full of complex calculation and various esoteric symbology.
The abstract notes becomes a bit more practical towards the end with what seems to be concrete observations and interpretations of results.

The latest lines read :

>"Direct exposure to moonlight did not seem to have been the contributing factor to the portal stability after all… Next date : _16 of Dandoledniss,_ don't have a lot of time to prepare, I'll try at home.  
>If unsuccessful try somewhere with lower altitude."

This journal has suffered quite a bit, but thankfully the latest entry is still legible.

>"Going to try again tonight (16th Dan.). If it doesn't work, I will probably need somewhere of lower altitude. Istyar has volunteered their home. I am not very enthuastic at the though of going in the slums... but they are living closer to the sea. The next window is between the 19th and the 21st of this month. I will have to refine my calculations later. I need to focus for tonight's attempt."
